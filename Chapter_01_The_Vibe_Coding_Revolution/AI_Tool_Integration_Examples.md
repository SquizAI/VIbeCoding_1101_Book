# AI Tool Integration Examples for Vibe Coding

This document provides practical examples of applying Vibe Coding techniques with popular AI-assisted development tools. Each example demonstrates how to effectively communicate with different AI systems to achieve specific coding tasks.

## Cursor Integration

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-native code editor built on top of VS Code that integrates advanced language models directly into your development workflow.

### Basic Usage Pattern

```
Apply to [file]

[Your prompt]
```

### Example 1: Creating a React Component

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Apply to src/components/ProductCard.tsx

Create a ProductCard component for an e-commerce site with the following:

1. Component should accept these props:
   - product: { id: string, name: string, price: number, image: string, rating: number }
   - onAddToCart: (id: string) => void

2. Style requirements:
   - Use styled-components
   - Card should have subtle shadow and rounded corners
   - Image should be responsive
   - Add a hover effect that slightly elevates the card
   - Include a star rating visualization

3. Behavior:
   - "Add to Cart" button should call the onAddToCart function with the product id
   - Price should be formatted with 2 decimal places and proper currency symbol ($)
   - Show "Out of stock" overlay if product.inventory === 0

4. Accessibility:
   - All interactive elements should be keyboard navigable
   - Include proper aria attributes
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast
```

### Example 2: Refactoring Code with Cursor

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Apply to src/utils/dataProcessing.js

Refactor this file to improve:

1. Performance - The current data processing is inefficient for large datasets
2. Readability - Add TypeScript types, proper comments, and meaningful variable names
3. Error handling - Add robust error handling for all edge cases
4. Modularity - Break down the large functions into smaller, reusable utilities

Make sure to maintain the same API so that existing code using these functions won't break.
```

### Example 3: Debugging with Cursor

**Cursor Prompt:**

```
Apply to src/hooks/useAuthentication.ts

Debug this authentication hook:

The current implementation has an issue where:
1. Users are sometimes logged out unexpectedly
2. Token refresh isn't working properly
3. There appears to be a race condition when multiple API calls happen simultaneously

Analyze the code and fix these issues while maintaining the current API structure.
```

## Windsurf Integration

[Windsurf](https://www.usewindsurf.com/) is an advanced AI IDE that supports agentic workflows, allowing for more complex project development through an AI Flow paradigm.

### Basic Usage Pattern

Windsurf uses a conversation-based approach but supports specialized commands for different tasks:

```
/write [description of what you want created]
/edit [file:line] [description of changes]
/explain [file or code snippet] [what you want explained]
/plan [description of feature or project]
```

### Example 1: Building a Feature with Windsurf

**Windsurf Prompt:**

```
/plan Create a user authentication system for a React application with the following requirements:

1. User registration with email verification
2. Login with email/password
3. Social login (Google, GitHub)
4. Password reset functionality
5. Protected routes with role-based access control
6. Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
7. Remember me functionality
8. Session timeout handling

I want to use Firebase Authentication as the backend service, but keep the code modular enough that we could switch to another auth provider in the future.
```

### Example 2: Multi-File Project Implementation

**Windsurf Prompt:**

```
/write I need to create a data visualization dashboard with the following components:

1. A responsive layout with sidebar navigation
2. A main dashboard that shows key metrics with cards
3. A line chart component that shows time-series data
4. A data table with sorting and filtering
5. A settings panel to configure dashboard preferences

Use React with TypeScript, styled-components for styling, and recharts for the visualization components. Follow a clean architecture pattern with separate folders for components, hooks, services, and types.
```

### Example 3: Debugging a Complex Issue with Windsurf

**Windsurf Prompt:**

```
I have a React application with a memory leak. When navigating between pages, the application gradually consumes more memory until it crashes. I suspect there are unsubscribed event listeners or uncancelled API requests.

/explain How can I systematically identify and fix memory leaks in a React application?

Then, I'd like you to help me implement a solution that includes:

1. A custom hook to properly manage subscriptions and cleanup
2. A utility for cancelling API requests when components unmount
3. A way to detect problematic components using the React Profiler
```

## Bolt Integration

[Bolt](https://bolt.new/) is a rapid prototyping platform that excels at generating complete project scaffolding from high-level descriptions.

### Basic Usage Pattern

Bolt uses a conversational interface combined with direct project editing. Start by describing your project goals:

```
Create a [type of project] that [description of functionality]
```

### Example 1: Creating a Full-Stack Application

**Bolt Prompt:**

```

   - Environment variable management
   - Logging and monitoring setup
```

### Example 2: Implementing a Specific Feature in Bolt

**Bolt Prompt:**

```
I'm working on an event management platform. Add a feature that allows users to:

1. Create recurring events with customizable frequency patterns
2. Send automated reminders to attendees
3. Handle timezone differences gracefully
4. Allow attendees to confirm/decline with calendar integration
5. Generate attendance reports after each event

The existing project uses React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend. Both use TypeScript.
```

### Example 3: Adding Tests with Bolt

**Bolt Prompt:**

```
Add comprehensive testing to my e-commerce project:

1. Unit tests for utility functions and hooks using Jest
2. Component tests using React Testing Library
3. API endpoint tests using Supertest
4. End-to-end tests using Cypress
5. Performance tests for critical user flows

Setup test automation to run on GitHub Actions with proper reporting and badge integration for the README.

[Format preferences or constraints]
```

### Example 1: System Architecture Design

**Claude Prompt:**

```
I'm building a scalable microservices-based e-commerce platform that needs to handle high traffic during promotional events. The system needs to include:

1. Product catalog service
2. Inventory management service
3. User account service
4. Order processing service
5. Payment gateway integration
6. Recommendation engine
7. Analytics service

Please design a system architecture that:

Present your answer as a detailed architecture diagram description, followed by technology recommendations for each component, and a discussion of potential bottlenecks and mitigation strategies.
```

### Example 2: Code Review with Claude

**Claude Prompt:**

```
I need you to review the following authentication middleware code for a Node.js/Express application:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication required' });
  }
  
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
  }
}

module.exports = authMiddleware;
```

Please review this code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Error handling improvements
3. Performance optimizations
4. Best practices adherence
5. Edge cases that aren't being handled

For each issue you identify, explain the problem and suggest a specific code improvement.
```

### Example 3: Learning and Exploration with Claude

I'm learning about state management approaches in modern React applications. I understand the basics of useState and useReducer, but I'm confused about when to use:

1. Context API
2. Redux
3. Zustand
4. Jotai
5. Recoil
6. MobX

Can you explain:

1. The core philosophy and approach of each solution
2. Their strengths and weaknesses
3. Appropriate use cases for each
4. Performance considerations
5. How they handle async operations
6. Developer experience and debugging capabilities

It would be helpful if you could include a simple example of the same functionality implemented in each approach to highlight the differences in syntax and structure.
```

## Advanced Multi-Tool Workflows

For complex projects, you can combine multiple AI tools in an effective workflow:

### Workflow Example: Full-Stack Application Development

1. **Start with Claude** to discuss and refine your application architecture and data model
2. **Use Bolt** to generate the initial project scaffolding with all necessary dependencies
3. **Use Windsurf** to plan and implement complex features that span multiple files
4. **Use Cursor** for focused enhancements and debugging of specific files

### Example Multi-Stage Prompt Sequence:

**Stage 1 - Architecture Planning with Claude:**

```
I need to build a collaborative task management application with the following requirements:

1. Real-time collaboration where multiple users can see and edit tasks simultaneously
2. Fine-grained permission system with team and project-level access control
3. Activity history and audit trail for all changes
4. Notification system (in-app, email, and optional SMS)
5. Integration capabilities with calendar apps and other productivity tools
6. Mobile-friendly design with offline support

I'm considering a stack with:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js backend with Express or NestJS
- WebSockets for real-time functionality
- PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- Redis for caching and pub/sub

Help me design this architecture with a focus on scalability and maintainability. Highlight any potential challenges and suggest specific implementation approaches for the real-time collaboration features.
```

**Stage 2 - Project Scaffolding with Bolt:**

```
Create a collaborative task management application with:

Frontend:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Socket.io client for real-time updates
- React Router for navigation
- Styled-components for styling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

Backend:
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript for type safety
- Socket.io for WebSocket communication
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Redis for caching and pub/sub
- JWT authentication with role-based permissions
- API documentation with Swagger

Development Environment:
- Docker Compose setup
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Jest and React Testing Library setup
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
```

**Stage 3 - Feature Implementation with Windsurf:**

```
/plan Implement the real-time collaboration feature for the task management application with the following requirements:

1. Users should see other users' cursor positions in real-time
2. Tasks should update in real-time across all connected clients
3. Show which users are currently viewing a task or project
4. Handle conflict resolution when multiple users edit the same field
5. Provide visual feedback when changes are being made
6. Implement optimistic UI updates with proper error recovery

The backend already has Socket.io setup with Redis for scaling. We need to implement both the backend event handlers and the frontend components to display and interact with real-time data.
```

**Stage 4 - Specific File Enhancement with Cursor:**

```
Apply to src/services/socketService.ts

Implement the socket service with the following requirements:

1. Create a singleton service that manages the Socket.io connection
2. Implement connection handling with automatic reconnection
3. Add typed event emitters and listeners using TypeScript generics
4. Include middleware for attaching authentication tokens to the connection
5. Add proper connection state management with React hooks
6. Implement event buffering for offline scenarios
7. Add comprehensive error handling and logging

The service should expose a clean API that other components can use without needing to directly interact with the Socket.io client.
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Lack of Context**: Failing to provide sufficient project context leads to generic solutions that don't integrate well
2. **Over-Specification**: Providing too many rigid constraints can prevent AI tools from suggesting better approaches
3. **Unclear Priorities**: Not distinguishing between essential requirements and preferences leads to suboptimal solutions
4. **Ignoring Tool Strengths**: Each AI tool has different strengths; assign tasks accordingly
5. **Skipping Verification**: Always review and test AI-generated code before integration

### Best Practices

1. **Start with High-Level Design**: Begin with architecture and design before diving into implementation details
2. **Maintain Context Continuity**: Reference previous discussions and decisions when switching between tools
3. **Provide Example Patterns**: Show examples of your preferred coding patterns and styles
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Start with a basic implementation and iteratively improve specific aspects
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Ask AI tools to explain their implementation choices to enhance your understanding
6. **Follow-Up Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions about generated code
7. **Verify and Test**: Always review AI-generated code for correctness, security, and performance
