# Plain Text to Prompt Patterns: The Art of Effective AI Communication

## Introduction to Prompt Patterns

In Vibe Coding, the ability to transform plain text descriptions into effective AI prompts is a foundational skill. This document provides practical examples and patterns to help you create prompts that produce high-quality code across different skill levels.

## The Evolution of a Prompt

The following examples demonstrate how a basic idea transforms through increasingly effective prompt patterns:

### Level 1: Basic Request (Beginner)

```
Create a login form for my website.
```

**Analysis**: This prompt lacks specificity, context, and constraints. The AI must make many assumptions, leading to generic and potentially misaligned results.

### Level 2: Detailed Description (Intermediate)

```
Create a login form for my website with email and password fields, 
a "Remember me" checkbox, and a submit button. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
```

**Analysis**: This prompt provides more details about what is needed but still leaves many aspects undefined, such as styling, validation, and behavior.

### Level 3: Structured Request (Advanced)

```
Create a responsive login form with the following:

Components:
- Email input field with validation
- Password field with strength indicator
- "Remember me" checkbox
- "Forgot Password" link
- Submit button

Technical requirements:
- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS with Flexbox layout
- Form validation using JavaScript
- Mobile-first responsive design

Style guidelines:
- Modern, clean look with rounded corners
- Blue and white color scheme
- Subtle animations for feedback
```

**Analysis**: This structured approach provides clear components and technical requirements, significantly improving the likelihood of getting usable code.

### Level 4: Complete Specification (Ninja)

```
PROJECT CONTEXT: E-commerce site rebrand with focus on mobile users
COMPONENT: User authentication login form
TECH STACK: HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), JavaScript (ES6+)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a responsive login form with these components:
   - Email input with real-time validation (RFC 5322 compliance)
   - Password field with strength indicator (weak/medium/strong)
   - "Remember me" checkbox that persists via localStorage
   - "Forgot Password" link that triggers a modal
   - Submit button with loading state

2. Technical specifications:
   - Semantic HTML5 markup with proper ARIA attributes
   - CSS using SCSS with BEM naming convention
   - Progressive enhancement approach
   - Validation with detailed error messages
   - Support for password managers
   - Keyboard navigation support

3. Visual design:
   - Match the provided brand colors (#3A86FF, #FFFFFF, #F5F5F5)
   - 8px grid system for spacing
   - 400ms transitions with ease-in-out timing
   - 16px base font size (Roboto)
   - Form width: 100% on mobile, max 420px on desktop

4. Behavior:
   - Display inline validation errors after field blur
   - Disable submit button until form is valid
   - Show loading spinner during authentication
   - Maintain field values on validation error

5. Accessibility:
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Support screen readers
   - Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1
   - Clear focus states

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: This form will integrate with our OAuth2 authentication system.
```

**Analysis**: This comprehensive prompt provides complete context, specific technical requirements, design parameters, behavior specifications, and accessibility considerations, enabling the AI to generate production-ready code.

## Effective Prompt Patterns

### 1. Role and Context Assignment

```
You are an experienced front-end developer who specializes in React and modern CSS. 
You prioritize accessibility and performance in all your work.

I need a component for my e-commerce website that displays product cards in a 
responsive grid. Each card should show the product image, name, price, rating, 
and an "Add to Cart" button.
```

**Why it works**: Defining the AI's role guides its perspective and expertise focus, resulting in code that follows best practices specific to that role.

### 2. Step-by-Step Decomposition

```
Let's create a data visualization dashboard step by step:

1. First, create the HTML structure with a header, sidebar, and main content area.
2. Next, add CSS to create a responsive grid layout.
3. Then, implement a line chart component using D3.js for showing time-series data.
4. After that, add a data table below the chart to display the raw values.
5. Finally, implement filters in the sidebar to allow filtering of the displayed data.
```

**Why it works**: Breaking complex tasks into sequential steps makes the process more manageable and allows for incremental validation.

### 3. Input-Processing-Output Framework

```
INPUT:
- JSON data containing user information (name, email, role, last login)
- Table must be sortable and filterable
- Maximum of 20 users displayed per page

PROCESSING:
- Parse JSON data
- Implement sorting functionality for all columns
- Create filtering system for roles
- Implement pagination

OUTPUT:
- Responsive HTML table with modern styling
- Sort indicators on column headers
- Filter dropdown for roles
- Pagination controls below the table
```

**Why it works**: This pattern clearly defines expectations for inputs, required processing, and desired outputs, leaving little room for misinterpretation.

### 4. Constraint Specification

```
Create a JavaScript function that calculates the optimal path for a delivery route.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must work with at least 25 waypoints
- Maximum execution time of 500ms for 20 waypoints
- Memory usage under 50MB
- No external libraries allowed
- Must handle invalid input gracefully
- Solution must work in all modern browsers
```

**Why it works**: Explicitly stating constraints helps the AI understand the boundaries and requirements that the solution must operate within.

### 5. Example-Driven Specification

```
Create a function that processes text data according to these examples:

Input: "Hello, world!"
Output: "HELLO, WORLD!"

Input: "The quick brown fox."
Output: "THE QUICK BROWN FOX."

Input: "a1b2c3"
Output: "A1B2C3"

Based on these examples, implement a function that takes a string as input and 
returns an uppercase version of the string.
```

**Why it works**: Providing concrete examples clarifies the expected behavior when specifications might be ambiguous.

### 6. Iterative Refinement

```
Initial prompt:
Create a weather app that shows the current weather.

Refinement 1:
The weather app looks good, but now add a 5-day forecast below the current weather.

Refinement 2:
Great! Now add location detection using the browser's geolocation API, with a 
fallback to manual city input.

Refinement 3:
I'd like to improve the UI with weather-appropriate backgrounds (sunny image for clear 
days, rain animation for rainy days, etc.)
```

**Why it works**: Starting with a basic implementation and iteratively adding features allows for a controlled development process and builds on successful previous steps.

## Skill-Specific Patterns

### For Beginners

Focus on clear, simple language with concrete examples:

```
I want to create a simple To-Do list app. Can you help me write the HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript for it? The app should:
- Let me add new tasks with a text input and button
- Display the list of tasks
- Allow me to mark tasks as completed (with a strikethrough)
- Let me delete tasks I don't need anymore

Please explain each part of the code so I can learn how it works.
```

### For Advanced Developers

Leverage technical terminology and system design concepts:

```
Implement a reactive state management system for a Vue.js application with the following characteristics:
- Centralized store pattern similar to Vuex/Redux
- TypeScript support with full type safety
- Action/mutation pattern for state changes
- Support for async operations with proper error handling
- Modular architecture with namespaced modules
- Computed state derivation with memoization
- DevTools integration for debugging

Optimize for performance and minimize re-renders.
```

## Tool-Specific Prompt Patterns

### For Code Editors (Cursor, VS Code with GitHub Copilot)

```
// filename: user-authentication.service.ts
// Create a TypeScript service for user authentication in Angular 15
// Requirements:
// - JWT-based authentication
// - Token refresh mechanism
// - Role-based access control
// - Persistent login with HttpOnly cookies
// - Integration with Angular's HTTP Interceptor
```

### For Chat Interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard)

```
I'm building a React Native e-commerce app and need to implement a product search feature.

Technical context:
- Using React Native 0.71
- Redux for state management
- REST API for backend communication
- Need to support iOS and Android

Requirements:
1. Create a search component with real-time results
2. Implement search history functionality
3. Add filters for categories, price range, and ratings
4. Optimize for performance on lower-end devices
5. Handle offline scenarios gracefully

Can you provide the implementation for this feature?
```

## Common Prompt Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Ambiguous Requirements

```
❌ Bad: Make me a nice website with lots of features.

✅ Better: Create a portfolio website for a photographer with a gallery, about page, contact form, and client portal. Use React, styled-components, and Firebase.
```

### 2. Missing Context

```
❌ Bad: Fix this code: function calculateTotal() { return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0); }

✅ Better: Fix this JavaScript code that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart but throws "items is not defined" error:
function calculateTotal() { return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0); }
```

### 3. Excessive Detail on Simple Tasks

```
❌ Bad: [2000 words of detailed specifications for a simple button component]

✅ Better: Create a reusable button component in React with primary, secondary, and danger variants. It should support different sizes (small, medium, large) and have disabled/loading states.
```
