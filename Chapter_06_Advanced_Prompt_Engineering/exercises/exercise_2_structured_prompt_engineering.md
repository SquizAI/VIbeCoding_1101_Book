## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will master the CRISPER framework for structured prompt engineering, applying it to solve progressively more complex software development challenges. You'll learn how to craft prompts that consistently yield high-quality results for various development tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Master the CRISPER framework for structured prompt engineering
- Develop skills in crafting precise, effective prompts for different development scenarios
- Learn how to iteratively refine prompts based on results
- Apply structured prompting to solve real development challenges
- Create a personal library of effective prompt structures

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of prompt engineering concepts
- Familiarity with software development workflows
- Access to an AI assistant that supports advanced prompting

## The CRISPER Framework

The CRISPER framework is a structured approach to prompt engineering, designed specifically for software development:

- **C**ontext: Provide relevant background information and project details
- **R**equirements: Clearly state what you need the AI to accomplish
- **I**mplementation Scope: Define the boundaries of what should be generated
- **S**pecific Constraints: Mention technologies, patterns, or standards to follow
- **P**rior Examples: Include snippets of existing code or desired patterns
- **E**xpected Output: Describe the format and structure of the desired result
- **R**eview Criteria: Specify how the output should be evaluated

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Basic CRISPER Implementation (30 minutes)

1. Choose a simple development task from one of these categories:
   - Creating a utility function (e.g., date formatter, input validator)
   - Implementing a basic UI component
   - Writing a database query
   - Creating a simple API endpoint

2. Create a structured prompt using the CRISPER framework:

```
## Context
[Provide relevant background about your project and what you're building]

## Requirements
[Clearly state what you need the AI to create or solve]

## Implementation Scope
[Define what should be included and excluded in the implementation]

## Specific Constraints
[List technologies, coding standards, and other constraints]

## Prior Examples
[Include relevant code snippets that show similar patterns]

## Expected Output
[Describe what the final result should look like]

## Review Criteria
[Specify how you'll evaluate the quality of the output]
```

3. Send your prompt to an AI assistant and evaluate the results
4. Make note of what worked well and what could be improved

### Step 2: Comparative Analysis (45 minutes)

1. Take the same development task from Step 1
2. Create three different versions of your prompt:
   - A basic, unstructured version (simple instructions without the CRISPER framework)
   - Your CRISPER prompt from Step 1
   - An enhanced CRISPER prompt with more detailed specifications

3. Submit all three prompts to an AI assistant (use different sessions to avoid context contamination)
4. Compare the results based on:
   - Code quality and correctness
   - Adherence to specifications
   - Comprehensiveness of the solution
   - Explanations and documentation provided

5. Document your findings about what elements had the biggest impact on results

### Step 3: Progressive Complexity Challenge (1 hour)

1. Select a moderately complex development task:
   - Creating a state management solution for a multi-step form
   - Implementing a caching mechanism
   - Designing a flexible data visualization component
   - Creating a middleware for authentication

2. Create a comprehensive CRISPER prompt for this task
3. Engage in a multi-turn interaction with the AI:
   - Start with your structured prompt
   - Ask clarifying questions about the AI's response
   - Provide feedback and request refinements
   - Use follow-up prompts that build on previous context

4. Document each step of the interaction and how the solution evolved

### Step 4: Domain-Specific Adaptations (1 hour)

1. Choose a specialized development domain:
   - Security (e.g., encryption, authentication)
   - Performance optimization
   - Accessibility
   - Testing and quality assurance
   - DevOps and CI/CD

2. Research the key considerations, best practices, and common pitfalls in this domain

3. Adapt the CRISPER framework for this specific domain by:
   - Adding domain-specific sections
   - Incorporating specialized review criteria
   - Including domain-specific examples and patterns

4. Create a domain-optimized prompt for a relevant task

5. Test your domain-specific prompt and evaluate how well it addresses the specialized concerns

### Step 5: Collaborative Challenge (1.5 hours)

1. Form a pair or small group with other developers
2. Choose a complex development challenge that would typically require collaboration:
   - Designing a microservice architecture
   - Creating a complex state management system
   - Implementing a sophisticated algorithm
   - Building a multi-step data processing pipeline

3. Collaborate to create a comprehensive CRISPER prompt for this challenge:
   - Each person contributes to different sections of the framework
   - Review each other's contributions for completeness and clarity
   - Consolidate into a cohesive final prompt

4. Submit your collaborative prompt to an AI assistant
5. As a group, evaluate the results and discuss:
   - How well did the structured approach work for complex problems?
   - What aspects of the problem were hardest to communicate via prompts?
   - How would you modify your approach for similar future challenges?

### Step 6: Prompt Refinement Workshop (1 hour)

1. Select one of your previous prompts that produced suboptimal results

2. Apply a systematic refinement process:
   - Identify specific weaknesses in the output
   - Analyze which parts of your prompt may have contributed to these issues
   - Research prompt engineering techniques specific to these challenges
   - Rewrite problematic sections with more precision and clarity

3. Test the refined prompt and compare results to the original

4. Document the specific improvements that had the biggest impact

5. Create a personal "prompt refinement checklist" based on your findings

### Step 7: CRISPER Template Library (1 hour)

1. Based on all your previous work, create a personal library of CRISPER templates for different types of development tasks:
   - Frontend component development
   - Backend API implementation
   - Database query optimization
   - Algorithm design
   - Testing and documentation

2. For each template:
   - Create a skeleton with section headers
   - Add guidance notes for filling in each section
   - Include example content for clarity
   - Note specific considerations for that type of task

3. Organize your templates in a searchable, reusable format

4. Test your templates on new development tasks and refine as needed

## Deliverables

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

1. A collection of CRISPER prompts for different development tasks
2. Comparative analysis of structured vs. unstructured prompting
3. Documentation of your multi-turn interaction process
4. A domain-specific adaptation of the CRISPER framework
5. A collaborative complex prompt example
6. A personal prompt refinement checklist
7. A library of CRISPER templates for future use

## Extension Activities

1. **Prompt Versioning**: Implement a version control approach for your prompts
2. **A/B Testing Framework**: Create a systematic method for testing prompt variations
3. **Custom Framework Development**: Adapt CRISPER or create your own framework for your specific domain
4. **Prompt Sharing Workshop**: Organize a session to share effective prompts with your team
5. **Integration with Development Workflow**: Design a system to integrate your prompts into your IDE or development tools

## Discussion Questions

1. How does the structure of a prompt influence the quality of AI-generated code?
2. What elements of the CRISPER framework proved most important for your specific tasks?
3. How do the needs of prompt engineering differ across frontend, backend, and infrastructure tasks?
4. What are the limitations of structured prompting, and when might other approaches be more effective?
5. How might prompt engineering frameworks evolve as AI capabilities advance?
