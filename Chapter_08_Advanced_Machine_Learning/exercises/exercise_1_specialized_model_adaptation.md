## Overview

In 2025, generic large language models (LLMs) have become commoditized with increasingly similar performance. The real value and innovation has shifted to specialization - adapting foundation models to excel at specific domains, tasks, and organizational contexts. This exercise will guide you through the process of adapting a foundation model to become a specialized expert in a specific domain, using the most efficient techniques available.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand different approaches to model adaptation and when to use each
- Implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques 
- Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for domain augmentation
- Evaluate model performance for domain-specific tasks
- Optimize the adapted model for efficient deployment

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Experience with Python and PyTorch
- Familiarity with transformers and language models
- Access to a compute environment with at least one GPU

## Project Requirements

### Part 1: Domain Selection and Data Preparation

1. **Select a specialized domain** for your model adaptation:
   - Medical (diagnosis, treatment recommendations, medical literature analysis)
   - Legal (contract analysis, case law research, compliance checking)
   - Scientific (research paper analysis, hypothesis generation)
   - Financial (market analysis, risk assessment, regulatory compliance)
   - Technical (software documentation, code generation, technical support)

2. **Gather domain-specific data**:
   - Collect 100-1000 high-quality documents from your chosen domain
   - Create a dataset of 50-100 domain-specific question/answer pairs for evaluation
   - Develop a domain-specific benchmark for measuring adaptation success

### Part 2: Implement and Compare Adaptation Techniques

3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**:
   ```python
   # Example structure for your RAG implementation
   from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
   from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
   from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
   from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline
   
   # Process documents
   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
   documents = text_splitter.split_documents(domain_documents)
   
   # Create vector store
   embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5")
   vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)
   
   # Create retrieval chain
   llm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id(
       model_id="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
       task="text-generation",
       model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.1, "max_length": 4096}
   )
   
   qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
       llm=llm,
       chain_type="stuff",
       retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
   )
   ```

4. **Implement Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**:
   ```python
   # Example structure for LoRA fine-tuning
   from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, TaskType
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TrainingArguments
   from trl import SFTTrainer
   
   # Load base model
   model_id = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
   
   # Define LoRA configuration
   lora_config = LoraConfig(
       r=16,
       lora_alpha=32,
       target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],
       lora_dropout=0.05,
       bias="none",
       task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM
   )
   
   # Apply LoRA to model
   peft_model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
   
   # Train the model
   training_args = TrainingArguments(
       output_dir="./results",
       num_train_epochs=3,
       per_device_train_batch_size=4,
       gradient_accumulation_steps=8,
       learning_rate=2e-4,
       weight_decay=0.01,
       save_steps=100,
   )
   
   trainer = SFTTrainer(
       model=peft_model,
       args=training_args,
       train_dataset=domain_dataset,
       tokenizer=tokenizer,
   )
   
   trainer.train()
   ```

5. **Implement Full Fine-Tuning (for comparison)**:
   - If you have sufficient compute resources, implement full fine-tuning of a smaller model
   - Compare results with the more efficient approaches

### Part 3: Evaluation and Optimization

6. **Comprehensive Evaluation**:
   - Domain-specific benchmark performance
   - Hallucination rate on domain questions
   - Response accuracy compared to expert sources
   - Performance on out-of-domain queries (to measure overfitting)

7. **Model Optimization for Deployment**:
   - Quantize the adapted model (8-bit or 4-bit)
   - Measure inference speed and resource usage before and after optimization
   - Document the tradeoffs between model size, speed, and accuracy

### Part 4: Hybrid Approach - Combining Techniques

8. **Build a hybrid specialized system** that combines:
   - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for core domain knowledge
   - RAG for accessing up-to-date or reference information
   - Structured outputs for key domain-specific tasks
   - A decision layer that routes requests to the appropriate subsystem

## Extension Challenges

1. **Multi-Task Specialization**: Adapt your model to handle 3-5 specific tasks within your domain exceptionally well

2. **Progressive Learning**: Implement a system that continues to learn from expert feedback or new documents

3. **Explainable Specialization**: Add mechanisms to make your specialized model explain its reasoning and cite sources for domain-specific claims

4. **Cross-Domain Adaptation**: Explore how well your adaptation techniques transfer to a second, related domain

## Evaluation Criteria

Your specialized model will be evaluated on:

1. **Domain Mastery**: How well it performs on domain-specific tasks compared to generic models
2. **Efficiency**: Resources required for adaptation and inference
3. **Implementation Quality**: Code organization, documentation, and engineering practices
4. **Innovation**: Novel approaches to specialization beyond the basic requirements
5. **Analysis**: Quality of your evaluation, insights on tradeoffs, and recommendations

## Submission Guidelines

Your submission should include:

1. All code in a well-organized repository with clear documentation
2. A detailed report explaining:
   - Your domain selection and data preparation process
   - Implementation details for each adaptation technique
   - Evaluation results with analysis
   - Optimization techniques and their impacts
   - Lessons learned and recommendations for specific use cases
3. A demonstration of your specialized model on representative domain tasks
4. A summary of resource requirements and practical considerations for deployment
