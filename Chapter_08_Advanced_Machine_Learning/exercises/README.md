## Vibe Coding: Where Human Creativity Meets AI Capabilities

</div>

Welcome to the Advanced Machine Learning exercises! This directory contains hands-on challenges designed to reinforce the concepts covered in Chapter 8 of the Vibe Coding textbook. These exercises range from specialized model adaptation to building AI agent systems and implementing multimodal learning.

## Exercise Overview

1. **[Specialized Model Adaptation](./exercise_1_specialized_model_adaptation.md)** - Learn to adapt foundation models to specific domains using techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This exercise focuses on creating highly specialized AI systems for particular domains.

2. **[Building AI Agent Systems](./exercise_2_building_ai_agents.md)** - Implement intelligent AI agents with planning capabilities and tool use. This exercise covers agent frameworks, memory systems, planning mechanisms, and multi-agent coordination for solving complex tasks.

3. **[Advanced Multimodal Learning](./exercise_3_multimodal_learning.md)** - Build state-of-the-art systems that can understand and generate content across multiple modalities (text, images, audio, video). Learn to implement cross-modal reasoning and alignment techniques.

## How to Use These Exercises

These exercises are designed to be practical and challenging, suitable for learners who have completed the Advanced and Ninja sections of Chapter 8. Each exercise includes:

- Detailed requirements and implementation guidance
- Code examples and starter templates
- Evaluation criteria
- Extension challenges for those seeking additional difficulty
- Resources for further learning

## Prerequisites

To complete these exercises, you should have:

- Strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals
- Experience with Python programming
- Familiarity with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow)
- Access to computing resources (local or cloud-based GPUs recommended)
- Knowledge of the concepts covered in Chapter 8 of the Vibe Coding textbook

## Submission and Evaluation

While these exercises are primarily for self-study, they're designed to build portfolio-worthy projects. After completing an exercise, consider:

1. Publishing your code on GitHub with detailed documentation
2. Writing a blog post explaining your approach and findings
3. Creating a demo video showcasing your implementation
4. Sharing your work with the Vibe Coding community for feedback
