   - Implement cross-attention mechanisms between modalities
   - Fine-tune the system on multimodal understanding tasks

   ```python
   import torch
   import torch.nn as nn
   from transformers import CLIPVisionModel, AutoModelForCausalLM

   class VisionLanguageModel(nn.Module):
       def __init__(
           self, 
           vision_model_name="openai/clip-vit-base-patch32", 
           language_model_name="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2"
       ):
           super().__init__()
           
           # Vision encoder
           self.vision_encoder = CLIPVisionModel.from_pretrained(vision_model_name)
           
           # Language model
           self.language_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
               language_model_name, 
               torch_dtype=torch.float16
           )
           
           # Vision projection to language dimension
           vision_hidden_size = self.vision_encoder.config.hidden_size
           language_hidden_size = self.language_model.config.hidden_size
           
           self.vision_projection = nn.Linear(
               vision_hidden_size, 
               language_hidden_size,
               bias=False
           )
           
           # Cross-attention for vision features
           self.cross_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
               embed_dim=language_hidden_size,
               num_heads=8,
               batch_first=True
           )
           
           # Layer norm and MLP for integration
           self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(language_hidden_size)
           self.mlp = nn.Sequential(
               nn.Linear(language_hidden_size, 4 * language_hidden_size),
               nn.GELU(),
               nn.Linear(4 * language_hidden_size, language_hidden_size)
           )
           
       def forward(self, images, input_ids, attention_mask):
           # Process images
           vision_outputs = self.vision_encoder(images).last_hidden_state
           vision_features = self.vision_projection(vision_outputs)
           
           # Process text
           language_features = self.language_model.model.embed_tokens(input_ids)
           
           # Apply cross-attention
           attended_features, _ = self.cross_attention(
               query=language_features,
               key=vision_features,
               value=vision_features
           )
           
           # Residual connection and layer norm
           language_features = language_features + self.layer_norm(attended_features)
           language_features = language_features + self.mlp(language_features)
           
           # Pass through language model
           language_outputs = self.language_model(
               inputs_embeds=language_features,
               attention_mask=attention_mask,
               return_dict=True

               )
           ])
           
       def __len__(self):
           return len(self.image_paths)

               return_tensors="pt"
           )
           
           input_ids = encoding["input_ids"].squeeze(0)
           attention_mask = encoding["attention_mask"].squeeze(0)
           
           return {

       image_inputs = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
       
       # Build reasoning prompt
       prompt = f"""
       I'm looking at an image and I need to answer a question through careful reasoning.
       
       Question: {question}
       
       Let me analyze this step by step:
       1. First, I'll describe what I see in the image.
       2. Then I'll identify the key elements related to the question.
       3. Next, I'll reason about how these elements relate to each other.
       4. Finally, I'll formulate my answer based on this analysis.
       
       Step 1: Description of the image:
       """
       
       # Generate reasoning
       inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
