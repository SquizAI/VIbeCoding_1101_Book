# Full-Stack Planning Methods

## 1. Unified System Architecture Planning

Before building a full-stack application, it's essential to develop a comprehensive architectural plan that addresses both frontend and backend concerns while defining clear integration points.

### Full-Stack Architectural Frameworks

#### 1. Clean Architecture
A layered approach that separates concerns with dependency rules flowing inward:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[UI/Presentation Layer] --> B[Application Layer]
    B --> C[Domain Layer]
    B --> D[Infrastructure Layer]
    D --> E[External Systems/Databases]
    
    style C fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Key principles:
- **Independence of frameworks**: The architecture doesn't depend on specific libraries or frameworks
- **Testability**: Business rules can be tested without UI, database, or external elements
- **Independence of UI**: The UI can change without affecting the rest of the system
- **Independence of database**: Business rules aren't bound to a specific database
- **Independence of external agencies**: Business rules don't know about external interfaces

#### 2. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
Centers the application around domain logic with "ports" defining interfaces and "adapters" connecting to external systems:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web UI] --> B[UI Adapter]
    C[Mobile UI] --> D[UI Adapter]
    B --> E[Input Ports]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Domain Core]
    F --> G[Output Ports]
    G --> H[Database Adapter]
    G --> I[External API Adapter]
    H --> J[Database]
    I --> K[External Service]
    
    style F fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style G fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

Benefits:
- Decouples business logic from external concerns
- Enables easy swapping of databases, UIs, or external services
- Facilitates testing by replacing external dependencies with mocks

#### 3. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern
Creates dedicated backend services tailored to specific frontend needs:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web Frontend] --> B[Web BFF]
    C[Mobile Frontend] --> D[Mobile BFF]
    E[Desktop Frontend] --> F[Desktop BFF]
    B --> G[Microservices]
    D --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[(Database)]
    
    style B fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

When to use:
- Different client platforms have significantly different data needs
- Frontend teams need control over their backend APIs
- Performance optimization is critical for specific clients

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document key architectural decisions to maintain alignment across frontend and backend teams:

```
# ADR-001: Authentication Strategy

## Status: Accepted

## Context:
The system requires user authentication across web and mobile clients with varying capabilities.

## Decision:
We will implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.

## Consequences:
- Stateless authentication simplifies scaling
- Frontend must securely store tokens
- Need to implement token refresh logic on both client and server
- Revocation requires additional mechanisms
```

## 2. API Contract Design

API contracts serve as the formal agreement between frontend and backend, defining precisely how they will communicate.

### Contract-First Development Workflow

1. **Define API contract** before implementation (OpenAPI, GraphQL schema, etc.)
2. **Generate code** from the contract (client SDKs, server stubs)
3. **Implement business logic** within the generated structure
4. **Validate implementations** against the contract

### API Specification Formats

#### REST API with OpenAPI (Swagger)
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Task Management API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /tasks:
    get:
      summary: List tasks
      parameters:
        - name: status
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
            enum: [pending, completed]
      responses:
        '200':
          description: List of tasks
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Task'
components:
  schemas:
    Task:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        title:
          type: string
        completed:
          type: boolean
      required:
        - id
        - title
        - completed
```

#### GraphQL Schema
```graphql
type Task {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  status: TaskStatus!
  dueDate: DateTime
  tags: [String!]
}

enum TaskStatus {
  TODO
  IN_PROGRESS
  COMPLETED
}

type Query {
  tasks(status: TaskStatus): [Task!]!
  task(id: ID!): Task
}

type Mutation {
  createTask(input: CreateTaskInput!): Task!
  updateTask(id: ID!, input: UpdateTaskInput!): Task!
  deleteTask(id: ID!): Boolean!
}

input CreateTaskInput {
  title: String!
  description: String
  status: TaskStatus = TODO
  dueDate: DateTime
  tags: [String!]
}

input UpdateTaskInput {
  title: String
  description: String
  status: TaskStatus
  dueDate: DateTime
  tags: [String!]
}
```

### Type-Safety Across Stack

To maintain consistency between frontend and backend:

1. **Shared type definitions**: Use TypeScript interfaces or JSON Schema shared between client and server
2. **Type generation**: Automatically generate types from your API contract
3. **Runtime validation**: Validate data at boundaries with libraries like Zod or Joi

Example of shared types with TypeScript:
```typescript
// shared-types.ts (imported by both frontend and backend)
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
}

export interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  status: 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
  assigneeId?: string;
  dueDate?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

## 3. Full-Stack MVP Definition

When planning a full-stack MVP, focus on end-to-end workflows that deliver core value while deferring non-essential features.

### Full-Stack MVP Planning Matrix

Create a matrix to identify essential features across the stack:

| Feature | UI Component | Frontend Logic | API Endpoint | Backend Service | Database | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| User Registration | Registration Form | Form validation, API call | POST /auth/register | AuthService | Users table | Must-Have |
| User Login | Login Form | Form validation, token storage | POST /auth/login | AuthService | Users table | Must-Have |
| Create Task | Task Form | Form validation, API call | POST /tasks | TaskService | Tasks table | Must-Have |
| View Tasks | Task List | Data fetching, filtering | GET /tasks | TaskService | Tasks table | Must-Have |
| Update Task | Task Edit Form | Form validation, API call | PUT /tasks/:id | TaskService | Tasks table | Must-Have |
| Delete Task | Delete Button | Confirmation, API call | DELETE /tasks/:id | TaskService | Tasks table | Must-Have |
| Task Categories | Category Selector | Filter by category | GET /categories | CategoryService | Categories table | Should-Have |
| User Profile | Profile Page | Form for user data | GET/PUT /users/me | UserService | Users table | Could-Have |
| Task Attachments | File Upload | File handling | POST /tasks/:id/attachments | AttachmentService | Attachments table | Won't-Have |

### End-to-End User Stories

Define complete user journeys that traverse the entire stack:

```
User Story: Task Creation and Management

As a registered user,
I want to create, view, and manage my tasks,
So that I can keep track of my work effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User can log in with email and password
2. User can create a new task with title, description, and due date
3. User can view a list of their tasks
4. User can mark tasks as complete
5. User can edit task details
6. User can delete tasks

Technical Implementation:
- Frontend: React components for login, task form, and task list
- API: Authentication endpoints, CRUD endpoints for tasks
- Backend: Authentication service, task service with CRUD operations
- Database: User table, task table with appropriate relations
```

## 4. Data Flow Planning

Plan how data will flow through your application from UI to database and back.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate read operations (queries) from write operations (commands):

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Interface] --> B[Command Handlers]
    A --> C[Query Handlers]
    B --> D[Domain Model]
    D --> E[Write Database]
    C --> F[Read Models]
    F --> G[Read Database]
    
    style B fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Benefits:
- Optimize read and write operations independently
- Scale read and write sides separately
- Simplify complex domain models

### State Management Planning

Define how application state is managed and synchronized:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[UI Events] --> B[Frontend State]
    B --> C[API Calls]
    C --> D[Backend Services]
    D --> E[Database]
    D --> F[API Responses]
    F --> B
    
    style B fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#9b59b6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

State synchronization strategies:
- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI immediately, roll back on error
- **Pessimistic updates**: Wait for server confirmation before updating UI
- **Real-time updates**: Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live data
- **Polling**: Regularly fetch updated data
- **Cache invalidation**: Clear cached data when it might be stale

## 5. Authentication Planning

Authentication is a critical cross-cutting concern in full-stack applications. Plan it comprehensively from the start.

### Authentication Flow Diagram

Map out the complete authentication process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant FE as Frontend
    participant BE as Backend
    participant DB as Database
    
    U->>FE: Enter credentials
    FE->>BE: POST /auth/login
    BE->>DB: Verify credentials
    DB-->>BE: User exists & password valid
    BE->>BE: Generate JWT & refresh token
    BE-->>FE: Return tokens & user info
    FE->>FE: Store tokens securely
    FE-->>U: Redirect to dashboard
    
    Note over FE,BE: Later - Token Refresh
    FE->>BE: POST /auth/refresh (with refresh token)
    BE->>BE: Validate refresh token
    BE-->>FE: New access token
```

### Authentication Decision Matrix

Evaluate authentication options based on your requirements:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| JWT | Stateless, scales well | Difficult to invalidate, size limitations | APIs, microservices |
| Session-based | Easy to invalidate, smaller payload | State management needed, extra DB lookups | Monolithic apps |
| OAuth/OIDC | Delegate auth to trusted providers, standards-based | Additional complexity, external dependency | Apps needing social login |
| Magic Links | Passwordless, improved UX | Email delivery dependency, security considerations | Consumer applications |

## 6. Testing Strategy Planning

Develop a comprehensive testing approach spanning both frontend and backend.

### Testing Pyramid

```
      /\
     /  \
    /E2E \
   /------\
  /  Int.  \
 /----------\
/ Unit Tests \
--------------
```

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user flows across the entire stack

### Full-Stack Testing Matrix

Plan which tests to write at each level:

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| UI Components | Component rendering, state changes | Form submissions, API call handling | N/A |
| Frontend Logic | Business logic, utility functions | State management, API client | N/A |
| API Layer | N/A | Endpoint contracts, status codes | N/A |
| Backend Services | Service methods, pure functions | Service interactions, database operations | N/A |
| Database Access | N/A | Query functionality | N/A |
| User Workflows | N/A | N/A | User journey simulations |

### Contract Testing

Test that the API implementation meets the contract specification:

1. **Consumer-driven contract tests**: Frontend defines expectations
2. **Provider contract tests**: Backend verifies it meets expectations
3. **Automated contract validation**: CI/CD pipeline validates contract compliance

## 8. Avoiding Full-Stack Over-Engineering

Full-stack applications are particularly susceptible to over-engineering due to their complexity. Here are strategies to maintain appropriate simplicity:

### Signs of Full-Stack Over-Engineering

1. **Premature service splitting**: Creating many microservices before they're needed
2. **Over-complex state management**: Using sophisticated state libraries for simple data
3. **Excessive abstraction layers**: Too many layers of indirection across the stack
4. **Framework feature overuse**: Using all features of frameworks regardless of need
5. **Anticipatory coding**: Building features "just in case" they're needed later

### Simplification Strategies

1. **Start with monolith**: Begin with a well-structured monolith before considering microservices
2. **Use boring technology**: Favor proven, simple solutions over cutting-edge complexity
3. **Feature flagging**: Build complex features behind toggles to control rollout
4. **End-to-end slices**: Implement complete, thin slices of functionality before adding breadth
5. **Continuous refactoring**: Evolve the architecture as needs become clearer

### Full-Stack Simplicity Principles

1. **Minimal viable API**: Keep API surface small and focused
2. **Single source of truth**: Avoid duplicating data and logic
3. **Shared vocabulary**: Use consistent naming across all layers
4. **Clear boundaries**: Define explicit interfaces between components
5. **Progressive enhancement**: Start simple and add complexity only when needed
