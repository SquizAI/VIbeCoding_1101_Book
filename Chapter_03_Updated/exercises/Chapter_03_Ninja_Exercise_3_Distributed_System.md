## üéØ Objective

Design and implement a resilient, scalable distributed system using AI as your architecture partner, leveraging advanced patterns like event sourcing, CQRS, and microservices.

## üìù Description

In this ninja-level exercise, you'll create a sophisticated task management platform as a distributed system with multiple specialized services communicating through events. You'll use AI to help with system design decisions, architectural patterns, resilience strategies, and advanced deployment configurations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Requirements

Your distributed system should include:

### Architectural Requirements:
1. Microservice architecture with clear bounded contexts
2. Event-driven communication between services
3. Implementation of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
4. Event sourcing for core domain entities
5. Polyglot persistence (use the right database for each service)
6. API Gateway for client communication

### Technical Requirements:
1. Service discovery and registration
2. Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
3. Distributed tracing and centralized logging
4. Message broker for event distribution
5. Authentication service with distributed token validation
6. Containerization and orchestration

### Functional Requirements:
1. User service (authentication, profiles, permissions)
2. Task service (core domain logic)
3. Notification service (email, push, in-app)
4. Analytics service (metrics, reporting)
5. Search service (full-text search capabilities)
6. Storage service (file attachments)

## üîç Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: System Architecture Design

Use AI to help with your architectural decisions:

```
Prompt: "I'm designing a distributed task management platform. Help me with:

1. Defining bounded contexts and service boundaries
2. Designing the event schema for inter-service communication
3. Creating a complete architecture diagram with all components
4. Selecting appropriate databases for each service
5. Designing the event sourcing model for the task domain
6. Planning the CQRS implementation for read/write operations
7. Defining the API Gateway routing and aggregation patterns"
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup

```
Prompt: "For my distributed task management system, I need to set up the infrastructure. Help me with:

1. Kubernetes manifest files for all services
2. Service mesh configuration (Istio/Linkerd)
3. Message broker setup (Kafka/RabbitMQ) with topics/exchanges
4. Distributed tracing configuration (Jaeger/Zipkin)
5. Centralized logging setup (ELK/EFK stack)
6. Prometheus and Grafana monitoring configuration
7. Terraform/Pulumi IaC scripts for cloud provisioning"
```

### Phase 3: Core Services Implementation

#### Event Sourcing & CQRS Implementation:

```
Prompt: "I'm implementing event sourcing and CQRS for my task management service. Help me with:

1. Domain event definitions with complete schema
2. Event store repository implementation
3. Command handlers with validation and business logic
4. Event handlers for updating read models
5. Projection strategies for different query requirements
6. Snapshot mechanisms for performance optimization
7. Event versioning and schema evolution approach"
```

#### API Gateway & Service Communication:

```
Prompt: "I need to implement the API Gateway and service communication for my distributed system. Please provide:

1. API Gateway routing configuration with rate limiting
2. Backend-for-frontend (BFF) implementation for specific clients
3. Service-to-service authentication mechanism
4. Asynchronous communication patterns with the message broker
5. Request/response correlation for distributed tracing
6. Circuit breaker implementation with fallback strategies
7. Retry policies with exponential backoff"
```

### Phase 4: Resilience & Scalability

```
Prompt: "I want to ensure my distributed system is resilient and scalable. Help me implement:

1. Chaos engineering tests to verify resilience
2. Autoscaling policies for all services
3. Cache strategies for frequently accessed data
4. Eventual consistency patterns for distributed transactions
5. Dead letter queues and error handling for failed events
6. Blue/green deployment strategies
7. Database sharding approach for horizontal scaling"
```

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

```
Prompt: "I want to add advanced features to my distributed task management system. Help me implement:

1. Real-time collaboration with conflict resolution
2. Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation
3. Sophisticated permission model with attribute-based access control
4. Workflow engine for complex task processes
5. Analytics pipeline for user behavior insights
6. Advanced search capabilities with faceting and filtering
7. Machine learning integration for task prioritization"
```

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

Your distributed system will be evaluated on:

1. **Architecture Quality**: Clear service boundaries, appropriate patterns
2. **Resilience**: Ability to handle failures gracefully
3. **Scalability**: Performance under increased load
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities
5. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable implementations
6. **Documentation**: Thorough technical documentation
7. **DevOps Integration**: Automated deployment and operations
8. **Security**: Proper authentication, authorization, and data protection

## üìù Submission Guidelines

Document your system with:

1. Comprehensive architecture diagrams
2. Service interface definitions
3. Event schemas and contracts
4. Database schemas
5. Deployment configurations
6. Development setup instructions
7. Monitoring dashboards
8. A detailed case study of how AI assisted your design and implementation

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start with a monolith**: Consider beginning with a modular monolith and extract services
2. **Event storming with AI**: Use AI to help with event storming sessions
3. **Infrastructure as code**: Define all infrastructure through code
4. **Version everything**: APIs, events, database schemas
5. **Automate aggressively**: CI/CD for all components
6. **Test at multiple levels**: Unit, integration, contract, chaos
7. **Documentation is critical**: In distributed systems, clear documentation prevents chaos

## üåü Bonus Challenges

For the true ninjas:

1. Implement multi-region deployment with data replication
2. Add advanced observability with distributed profiling
3. Create a custom DSL for workflow definitions
4. Implement a service mesh with custom sidecars
5. Build a developer portal for internal service documentation
6. Implement GraphQL federation across multiple services
7. Create a custom operator for Kubernetes
