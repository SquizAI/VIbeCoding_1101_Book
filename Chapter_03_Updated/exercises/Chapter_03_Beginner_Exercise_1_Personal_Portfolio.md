## üéØ Objective

Create a complete personal portfolio website using AI assistance throughout the entire development process, from planning to deployment.

## üìù Description

In this exercise, you'll build a professional portfolio website to showcase your projects, skills, and experience. You'll use AI to help with planning, design decisions, content creation, and coding. This project will demonstrate how AI can assist throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Requirements

Your portfolio website should include:

1. A responsive, modern design that works well on desktop and mobile devices
2. A homepage with a hero section introducing yourself
3. An "About Me" section highlighting your background and skills
4. A projects section showcasing 3-5 projects (real or sample)
5. A contact section with a working contact form
6. Professional styling with cohesive colors, typography, and layout

## üîç Getting Started

### 1. Planning Phase

Use AI to help plan your project:

```
Prompt: "I want to create a personal portfolio website as a web developer. 
Can you help me plan this project by:
1. Suggesting the main sections I should include
2. Recommending a tech stack suitable for a beginner (I know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
3. Creating a simple site structure diagram
4. Proposing a development timeline with milestones"
```

### 2. Design Phase

Work with AI to develop the visual design:

```
Prompt: "I'm designing my portfolio website. Can you suggest:
1. A color palette that conveys professionalism and creativity
2. Typography suggestions (heading and body fonts)
3. Layout ideas for the main sections
4. How to make the site responsive for mobile devices"
```

### 3. Content Creation

Generate starter content for your portfolio:

```
Prompt: "Can you help me draft content for my portfolio website? I'm a junior web developer
with skills in [list your actual skills or ones you'd like to showcase]. 
Please generate:
1. A professional bio for my About section (200-300 words)
2. Descriptions for 3 sample web development projects
3. A list of skills to highlight, categorized by type (frontend, backend, tools, etc.)
4. A professional headline for my homepage"
```

### 4. Development Phase

Get AI assistance for the actual coding:

```
Prompt: "I'm ready to start building my portfolio website. Can you generate the HTML and CSS for:
1. A responsive navigation bar with links to all sections
2. A hero section with my name and headline
3. Basic structure for the About, Projects, and Contact sections
I'd like to use a clean, modern design with [mention your color preferences]."
```

### 5. Implementation of Interactive Elements

Add JavaScript functionality:

```
Prompt: "I need to add some interactive elements to my portfolio. Can you provide JavaScript code for:
1. A contact form with validation that sends data to an email or stores it (choose approach)
2. A project filter or search feature for my Projects section
3. A smooth scroll effect when navigation links are clicked
4. A mobile-friendly navigation menu that toggles on small screens"
```

### 6. Testing and Refinement

Use AI to help improve your site:

```
Prompt: "My portfolio website is nearly complete. Can you suggest:
1. Ways to improve performance and page load speed
2. SEO optimizations I should implement
3. Accessibility improvements to ensure the site works for everyone
4. Cross-browser compatibility checks I should perform"
```

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

Your portfolio project will be evaluated on:

1. **Completeness**: All required sections are implemented
2. **Design Quality**: Visually appealing and professional appearance
3. **Responsiveness**: Works well on various screen sizes
4. **Code Quality**: Well-structured, readable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
5. **AI Collaboration**: Effective use of AI throughout the development process
6. **Personalization**: Customized beyond the AI-generated suggestions to reflect your style

## üìù Submission Guidelines

Document your process with:

1. Screenshots of your AI conversations showing how you used AI assistance
2. Your planning documents and design decisions
3. The final code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with comments explaining your approach
4. A reflection on how AI assisted your development process and what you learned

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be specific in your prompts**: The more details you provide about your preferences and goals, the better results you'll get.
2. **Iterate with AI**: Don't settle for the first response. Ask for revisions and improvements.
3. **Understand the code**: Ask the AI to explain any code you don't understand so you learn while building.
4. **Add personal touches**: Modify the AI-generated content to truly represent you.
5. **Consider hosting**: Deploy your site using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for a live portfolio.
