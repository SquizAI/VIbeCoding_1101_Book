# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

## Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs to AI systems to elicit desired outputs. In software development, strategic prompt construction can determine the quality, relevance, and usability of AI-generated code and solutions. This document covers fundamental concepts and techniques that serve as building blocks for advanced prompt engineering.

## Core Principles of Effective Prompts

### 1. Clarity

Clear prompts eliminate ambiguity and provide precise direction to the AI:

```
✅ "Create a JavaScript function that sorts an array of objects by the 'price' property in ascending order."

❌ "Make a function that sorts things."
```

### 2. Context

Contextual information helps the AI understand the broader purpose and constraints:

```
✅ "I'm building an e-commerce checkout system using React. Create a function that calculates tax based on the user's location. The application already has a 'userLocation' object with state and country codes."

❌ "Write a function to calculate tax."
```

### 3. Specificity

Specific requirements lead to more tailored and useful responses:

```
✅ "Create a PostgreSQL query that returns the top 5 customers by total purchase amount in the last 30 days. Include their name, email, and total spend. The database has tables 'customers' and 'orders' with a customer_id relationship."

❌ "Give me a SQL query about customers."
```

### 4. Formatting

Explicit format requirements ensure the response is structured as needed:

```
✅ "Write a React component that displays a paginated list of products. Structure your response with:
1. Imports at the top
2. Component definition with TypeScript types
3. JSX structure
4. Export statement"

❌ "Make a product list component."
```

### 5. Constraints

Defining limitations and requirements focuses the AI on viable solutions:

```
✅ "Create a data fetching utility using the Fetch API. It should handle timeouts after 5 seconds, include retries (max 3), and work in browsers that support ES6. Do not use external libraries."

❌ "Make an API call function."
```

## The RECIPE Framework for Prompt Construction

### R - Role

Assigning a role to the AI can optimize responses for specific knowledge domains:

```
"Act as a senior security engineer reviewing my authentication implementation. Identify potential vulnerabilities and suggest improvements."
```

### E - Expertise Level

Indicating your expertise helps calibrate the response complexity:

```
"I'm an experienced backend developer but new to GraphQL. Explain how to set up a basic GraphQL server with Node.js, providing code examples that I can follow."
```

### C - Context

Providing background information creates appropriate framing:

```
"I'm developing a mobile app for restaurant reservations. The app needs to handle peak booking times when many users might try to reserve the same table simultaneously."
```

### I - Intent

Clearly stating your goal helps focus the response:

```
"I need to optimize database queries for a reporting dashboard that currently takes over 30 seconds to load."
```

### P - Parameters

Defining specific requirements and constraints:

```
"The solution must:
- Work with MySQL 8.0
- Support multilingual content
- Be compatible with PHP 8.1
- Include appropriate indexes
- Consider query caching strategies"
```

### E - Examples

Including examples clarifies expectations:

```
"Here's an example of the current query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id WHERE orders.date > '2023-01-01'
```

And here's partial example of what I'm looking for:
```sql
SELECT o.id, o.total, c.name FROM orders o JOIN ...
```"
```

## Advanced Pattern: Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Breaking down complex problems through explicit reasoning steps:

```
I need to design a caching strategy for a distributed web application. 

Let's think about this systematically:

1. First, what are the types of data that need caching? Consider user session data, application configuration, database query results, and API responses.

2. For each data type, what are the access patterns? Which are read-heavy vs. write-heavy? What's the frequency of updates?

3. What are the consistency requirements for each type of data? Can some allow eventual consistency while others need immediate consistency?

4. What are the available caching technologies in our stack, and what are their strengths/weaknesses?

5. How will cache invalidation be handled for each data type?

Based on this analysis, please recommend a caching strategy that addresses these considerations.
```

## Advanced Pattern: Few-Shot Learning

Providing examples to establish patterns:

```
I need to write validation functions for a form. Here are two examples:

Function 1:
```javascript
// Validates email format
function validateEmail(email) {
  const regex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  if (!email || !regex.test(email)) {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Please enter a valid email address' };
  }
  return { valid: true };
}
```

Function 2:
```javascript
// Validates password strength
function validatePassword(password) {
  if (!password || password.length < 8) {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters long' };
  }
  if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Password must contain at least one uppercase letter' };
  }
  if (!/[0-9]/.test(password)) {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Password must contain at least one number' };
  }
  return { valid: true };
}
```

Following this pattern, please create validation functions for:
1. Username (alphanumeric, 3-20 characters)
2. Phone number (format: XXX-XXX-XXXX)
3. Credit card number (using Luhn algorithm)
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Iterative Refinement

Begin with a base prompt and refine based on results:

```
Base prompt: "Create a function to validate user input."

Refined prompt: "Create a TypeScript function that validates user registration input. 
It should check email format, password strength (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number), 
and username (alphanumeric, 3-20 chars). Return an object with a 'valid' boolean 
and an 'errors' array containing specific validation failures."
```

### 2. Breaking Down Complex Tasks

Split complex requirements into separate prompts:

```
Instead of: "Create a complete e-commerce checkout system with cart, payment processing, and order management."

Better approach:
1. First prompt: "Design the data models for an e-commerce checkout system."
2. Second prompt: "Create the shopping cart component with add/remove functionality."
3. Third prompt: "Implement the checkout form with validation."
4. Fourth prompt: "Develop the payment processing integration."
```

### 3. Providing Reference Materials

Include relevant documentation or code snippets:

```
"I'm using the following library for API calls:

```javascript
// Current API client setup
import ApiClient from 'api-client';
const client = new ApiClient({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 3000,
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
});
```

Please show how to add request interceptors to this client to handle authentication tokens."
```

### 4. Using Markdown for Clarity

Structure prompts with markdown for readability:

```
## Task
Create a React custom hook for managing form state

## Requirements
- Support for text, checkbox, and select inputs
- Validation functionality
- Submission handling
- Error tracking

## Example Usage
```jsx
const { values, errors, handleChange, handleSubmit } = useForm({
  initialValues: { name: '', email: '', agreeToTerms: false },
  validate: (values) => {
    // Validation logic
  },
  onSubmit: (values) => {
    // Submission logic
  }
});
```
```

### 5. Evaluating and Refining Results

Provide feedback on AI outputs to improve future responses:

```
"The function you provided works for most cases, but it doesn't handle the edge case of empty arrays. Could you update it to return a default value of 0 when the input array is empty?"
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overly vague requests**: "Make an app" vs. "Create a React weather app that fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API"

2. **Insufficient context**: Not explaining the broader system or dependencies

3. **Unrealistic expectations**: Requesting complete complex systems in one go

4. **Neglecting edge cases**: Not specifying how to handle errors or unusual inputs

5. **Ignoring performance considerations**: Not mentioning scalability or efficiency requirements

6. **Skipping validation criteria**: Not defining how to evaluate the success of the solution

7. **Technical mismatch**: Requesting solutions incompatible with your tech stack

## Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Relevance**: How well does the response address the specific task?

2. **Correctness**: Is the generated code or solution accurate and error-free?

3. **Completeness**: Does it cover all aspects of the requirements?

4. **Efficiency**: Is the solution optimized and efficient?

5. **Clarity**: Is the response well-structured and easy to understand?

6. **Adaptability**: How easily can the solution be integrated into the existing codebase?

### Scoring System

For each prompt-response pair, rate on a scale of 1-5:

```
Relevance:     ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Correctness:   ⭐⭐⭐⭐⚪
Completeness:  ⭐⭐⭐⚪⚪
Efficiency:    ⭐⭐⭐⭐⚪
Clarity:       ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Adaptability:  ⭐⭐⭐⚪⚪

Overall Score: 21/30
```
