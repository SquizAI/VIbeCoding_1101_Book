     - Process observation (if applicable)
     - Stakeholder interviews (if applicable)
     - Outcome examination

4. **Analysis and Findings Documentation**
   - Conduct detailed analysis to:
     - Identify ethical concerns
     - Evaluate severity and impact
     - Determine root causes
     - Assess systemic patterns
     - Document evidence trails

### Part 3: Comprehensive Reporting

Create a professional-quality audit report:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Develop a concise summary including:
     - Audit scope and objectives
     - Methodology overview
     - Key findings summary
     - Critical recommendations
     - Implementation considerations

2. **Detailed Findings**
   - Document each finding with:
     - Description and ethical dimension
     - Evidence summary
     - Impact analysis
     - Root cause assessment
     - Severity classification
     - Recommendation overview

3. **Recommendations and Action Plan**
   - Create detailed recommendations including:
     - Specific actions to address each finding
     - Required resources and expertise

     - Reference materials
     - Glossary of terms

**Sample Finding Structure:**

**Finding 1: Demographic Proxy Variables in User Preference Algorithm**

*Description:* The recommendation algorithm uses zip code as a primary factor in determining user preferences, creating a potential proxy for demographic characteristics.

*Evidence:* 
- Code review reveals zip code has a 0.35 weighting factor in the preference calculation
- No documentation justifying zip code as a predictor of user preferences
- Testing shows 28% variance in recommendations across zip codes with similar user behavior

*Impact:* Users from certain geographic areas may receive systematically different recommendations, potentially reinforcing existing social disparities.

*Root Cause:* Initial AI-generated algorithm incorporated zip code based on statistical correlations in training data without ethical evaluation.

*Severity:* High - Creates systemic differential treatment with potential reinforcement of societal inequities.

*Recommendation:* Replace zip code with more direct preference indicators, implement regular outcome monitoring across geographic regions, and establish guidelines for proxy variable identification.
