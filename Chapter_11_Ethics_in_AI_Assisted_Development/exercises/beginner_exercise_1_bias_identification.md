# Beginner Exercise 1: Bias Identification in AI-Generated Code

## Overview

AI coding assistants can unintentionally reproduce or amplify biases present in their training data. This exercise helps you develop skills to identify potential biases in AI-generated code and understand their implications.

## Objectives

- Develop awareness of common biases in AI-generated code
- Practice identifying biased assumptions in code suggestions
- Learn to recognize when an AI assistant might be reinforcing stereotypes
- Understand the real-world impacts of biased code

## Exercise

### Part 1: Understanding Bias Categories

Before examining code, familiarize yourself with common categories of bias that can appear in AI-generated code:

1. **Representational Bias**: When code includes assumptions that fail to represent diverse user groups (e.g., assuming all users have high-speed internet)

2. **Algorithmic Bias**: When code logic or algorithms systematically favor certain groups over others (e.g., recommendation systems that reinforce majority preferences)

3. **Interaction Bias**: When UI/UX elements assume certain user capabilities or preferences (e.g., color schemes that don't account for color blindness)

4. **Data Modeling Bias**: When data structures encode biased assumptions about what data is important or how it should be organized (e.g., binary gender fields)

5. **Language Bias**: When variable names, comments, or documentation use exclusionary or stereotypical language (e.g., gendered pronouns for generic users)

### Part 2: Bias Identification in Samples

Examine the following scenarios where you asked an AI assistant to generate code, and identify potential biases in each response:

**Scenario 1: User Profile Form**
You asked an AI assistant to create a user profile form. Review the generated code and identify any biases:

```
// What might be problematic about fields like:
// - Name fields that assume Western naming conventions
// - Binary gender options
// - Required fields that assume all users will have certain information
// - Address formats that assume specific geographical structures
// - Accessibility issues in the form design
```

**Scenario 2: Content Recommendation Algorithm**
You asked an AI assistant to create a recommendation algorithm. Identify potential biases:

```
// What might be problematic about:
// - Preference for popular content that reinforces majority tastes
// - Assumptions about user interests based on demographic information
// - Filter bubbles that limit exposure to diverse content
// - Lack of consideration for culturally diverse preferences
```

**Scenario 3: Financial Application**
You asked an AI assistant to create a loan eligibility calculator. Identify potential biases:

```
// What might be problematic about:
// - Variables that correlate with protected characteristics
// - Assumptions about "normal" financial behaviors
// - Hard-coded thresholds that might disadvantage certain groups
// - Missing consideration of alternative financial histories
```

### Part 3: Real-World Implications

For each bias you identified, consider the potential real-world impacts:

1. Who might be excluded or disadvantaged by this code?
2. What incorrect assumptions does the code make about users?
3. How might these biases affect users' experience and access to services?
4. How might these biases compound over time or at scale?

### Part 4: Alternative Approaches

For each identified bias, propose more inclusive alternatives:

1. How could the code be rewritten to be more inclusive?
2. What additional considerations should be included in requirements?
3. How might you prompt the AI assistant differently to avoid these biases?
4. What review processes could help catch these biases before deployment?

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, reflect on the following questions:

1. What patterns did you notice across the different examples of bias?

2. How might your own background and experiences influence which biases you more easily recognize versus those you might overlook?

3. What responsibility do you have as a developer to address bias in AI-generated code?

4. How can you integrate bias identification into your regular development workflow when using AI assistants?

5. What additional knowledge or resources would help you better identify biases in specific domains?

## Extension Activities

1. **Collaborative Identification**: Share your bias analysis with colleagues and compare perspectives. Did they identify different biases?

2. **Real-World Examination**: Analyze a real AI-generated code snippet from your work and identify potential biases.

3. **Bias Mitigation Plan**: Develop a personal checklist for reviewing AI-generated code for bias in your specific domain.

4. **Alternative Prompting**: Experiment with different prompting techniques that explicitly ask the AI assistant to consider diversity and inclusion.

## Submission

Document your bias identification analysis, proposed alternatives, and reflections in a structured format. Include specific examples and the reasoning behind your identification of each bias.
