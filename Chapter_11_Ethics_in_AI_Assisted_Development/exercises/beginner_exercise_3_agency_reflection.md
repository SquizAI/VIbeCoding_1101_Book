# Beginner Exercise 3: Agency Reflection

## Overview

This exercise helps you reflect on developer agency in AI-assisted development. Agency refers to your ability to maintain meaningful control, understanding, and decision-making power when working with AI coding assistants. Through structured reflection and practice, you'll develop strategies to preserve your agency while benefiting from AI assistance.

## Objectives

- Recognize signs of diminishing agency in AI-assisted development
- Understand the importance of maintaining developer agency
- Develop practical strategies to enhance agency while using AI assistants
- Create personal guidelines for agency-preserving AI collaboration

## Exercise

### Part 1: Understanding Developer Agency

Begin by understanding what developer agency means in the context of AI-assisted development:

**Key Dimensions of Developer Agency:**

1. **Decision Autonomy**: The ability to make intentional choices about code structure, approaches, and implementation details
2. **Understanding**: Comprehension of how your code works and why particular approaches were chosen
3. **Skill Development**: Continued growth of your programming skills and knowledge
4. **Intentionality**: Working with purpose rather than accepting suggestions without consideration
5. **Control**: The ability to guide the development process toward desired outcomes

**Indicators of Strong Developer Agency:**
- You can explain how all parts of your code work
- You make conscious choices about which AI suggestions to accept
- You maintain and develop your programming skills
- You direct the AI rather than being directed by it
- You feel ownership of the final code

**Indicators of Diminishing Agency:**
- You accept AI suggestions without understanding them
- You struggle to modify or debug AI-generated code
- You notice your skills plateauing or declining
- You feel dependent on AI for tasks you once did independently
- You cannot explain why certain approaches were chosen

### Part 2: Personal Agency Reflection

Reflect on your own experiences with AI-assisted development:

1. **Recent Project Analysis:**
   Select a recent project where you used AI assistance. For each major component:
   - Rate your understanding of the code (1-10)
   - Note whether you could modify the code without AI help
   - Identify parts you couldn't explain to another developer
   - Consider whether you made conscious decisions or simply accepted suggestions

2. **Skill Impact Assessment:**
   Consider how AI assistance has affected your skills:
   - Which skills have improved through AI collaboration?
   - Which skills might be atrophying from lack of practice?
   - What knowledge gaps have you noticed?
   - How has your learning approach changed?

3. **Decision Patterns:**
   Analyze your decision patterns with AI assistants:
   - Do you tend to accept suggestions without review?
   - How often do you modify AI-generated code?
   - Do you consciously choose when to use AI versus coding manually?
   - How do you determine which tasks to delegate to AI?

4. **Dependency Evaluation:**
   Honestly assess your level of dependency:
   - Could you complete your recent projects without AI assistance?
   - Are there tasks you no longer attempt without AI help?
   - Do you feel anxiety when working without AI tools?
   - Has your confidence in your programming abilities changed?

### Part 3: Agency Preservation Strategies

Based on your reflections, develop personalized strategies to preserve your agency:

1. **Understanding Enhancement:**
   Create a practice plan to ensure understanding of AI-generated code:
   - Will you review each AI suggestion before accepting?
   - How will you ensure you understand complex AI-generated code?
   - What questions will you ask yourself before accepting suggestions?
   - How will you document your understanding?

2. **Skill Maintenance:**
   Develop a strategy to maintain and develop your skills:
   - Which coding skills do you need to practice regularly?
   - How will you balance manual coding with AI assistance?
   - What learning activities will counterbalance potential skill atrophy?
   - How will you track your skill development?

3. **Intentional Collaboration:**
   Plan how to work more intentionally with AI assistants:
   - When will you choose to use AI versus coding manually?
   - How will you prepare before engaging with AI tools?
   - What prompting strategies will help you maintain control?
   - How will you evaluate and refine AI suggestions?

4. **Dependency Management:**
   Create guidelines to prevent unhealthy dependency:
   - What "coding without AI" time will you schedule?
   - Which skills will you deliberately practice without assistance?
   - How will you challenge yourself to solve problems independently?
   - What boundaries will you set around AI usage?

### Part 4: Personal Agency Guideline Development

Synthesize your reflections and strategies into a personal agency guideline document:

**Document Structure:**
1. **Personal Agency Statement**: Your philosophy on maintaining agency with AI tools
2. **Usage Boundaries**: Clear guidelines on when and how you'll use AI assistance
3. **Review Practices**: Specific practices for reviewing and understanding AI code
4. **Skill Development Plan**: Strategy for ongoing skill maintenance and growth
5. **Reflection Schedule**: Regular times to revisit and assess your agency
6. **Red Flags**: Indicators that might suggest diminishing agency
7. **Corrective Actions**: Steps to take if you notice agency concerns

Make your guidelines specific, actionable, and tailored to your personal development goals.

## Reflection Questions

After completing this exercise, reflect on the following questions:

1. What aspects of your agency are most at risk when using AI coding assistants?

2. How does your level of expertise in a domain affect your ability to maintain agency when using AI in that area?

3. What benefits have you gained from AI assistance that support rather than diminish your agency?

4. How might your approach to agency preservation change as AI capabilities continue to advance?

5. How could development teams collectively support agency while leveraging AI assistance?

## Extension Activities

1. **Agency Dialogue**: Discuss agency concerns and strategies with colleagues who use AI assistance.

2. **Experimentation**: Try different approaches to AI collaboration and document their impact on your sense of agency.

3. **Before/After Comparison**: Complete a small project without AI, then a similar one with AI, and compare your experiences of agency.

4. **Team Guidelines**: Expand your personal guidelines into a proposal for team-level agency preservation.

## Submission

Submit your personal agency reflection, including your analysis of recent projects, identified patterns, agency preservation strategies, and personal guidelines document.
