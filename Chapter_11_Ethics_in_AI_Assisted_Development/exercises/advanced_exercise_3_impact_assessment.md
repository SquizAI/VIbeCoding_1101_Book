# Advanced Exercise 3: Ethical Impact Assessment

## Overview

This exercise guides you through conducting a comprehensive ethical impact assessment for an AI-assisted development project. Ethical impact assessments help identify potential ethical issues before they arise and develop mitigation strategies to address them.

## Objectives

- Develop skills in systematically evaluating ethical impacts of AI-assisted development
- Practice identifying potential ethical issues across multiple dimensions
- Learn to develop effective mitigation strategies for ethical risks
- Create documentation that supports ethical decision-making throughout a project lifecycle

## Exercise

### Part 1: Select a Project

Choose either:
- A real AI-assisted development project you're currently working on or have worked on
- A hypothetical project based on the following scenario:

**Scenario**: Your team is developing a recommendation system for a job search platform. The system will match job seekers with potential opportunities based on their resumes, past applications, and behavior on the platform. You plan to use AI coding assistants extensively in developing the matching algorithms, data processing pipeline, and user interface.

### Part 2: Stakeholder Analysis

Identify all stakeholders who might be affected by the project:

1. **Direct Stakeholders**: Those directly involved with or impacted by the system (e.g., job seekers, employers, recruiters, development team)

2. **Indirect Stakeholders**: Those indirectly affected by the system (e.g., industry sectors, communities, future employees)

3. **Marginalized Groups**: Identify potentially vulnerable groups who might be disproportionately affected (e.g., older workers, people with disabilities, people from underrepresented backgrounds)

4. **Institutional Stakeholders**: Organizations with relevant oversight or interest (e.g., regulatory bodies, industry associations)

For each stakeholder group, document:
- Their interests and concerns related to the project
- Potential benefits they might receive
- Potential harms or risks they might face
- Their relative power and vulnerability

### Part 3: Ethical Dimension Analysis

Assess the project across five key ethical dimensions:

#### 1. Fairness and Bias

- How might bias be introduced through AI-generated code?
- What groups might be advantaged or disadvantaged?
- How could the system perpetuate or amplify existing inequalities?
- What might be missing from consideration in the AI-generated approaches?

#### 2. Transparency and Explainability

- How well can the team explain how the system works?
- Will stakeholders understand how decisions are made?
- What aspects of the system might be difficult to explain?
- How is the role of AI in development documented and communicated?

#### 3. Developer and User Agency

- How will the project affect developer understanding and control?
- Will users have appropriate control over how the system affects them?
- Are there areas where over-reliance on AI might reduce human agency?
- How will the balance of decision-making between humans and AI be managed?

#### 4. Privacy and Data Usage

- What data will be collected, processed, and stored?
- How might AI-generated code handle sensitive data?
- Are there privacy implications in the training data used by AI assistants?
- How will consent and data minimization be addressed?

#### 5. Long-term and Systemic Impacts

- What broader societal effects might the system have?
- How might the development approach affect team skills long-term?
- What environmental or resource impacts should be considered?
- How might the system evolve over time?

### Part 4: Risk Assessment and Mitigation

For each ethical concern identified:

1. **Assess Likelihood**: How likely is this issue to occur? (Low/Medium/High)
2. **Assess Impact**: If it occurs, how severe would the impact be? (Low/Medium/High)
3. **Calculate Risk Level**: Combine likelihood and impact (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
4. **Develop Mitigation Strategy**: Create specific steps to address the risk
5. **Assign Responsibility**: Determine who will be responsible for implementation
6. **Define Monitoring Approach**: How will you check if mitigation is working?

Create a risk register table documenting these elements for each identified risk.

### Part 5: Ethical Governance Framework

Develop a governance framework for ongoing ethical oversight:

1. **Decision Points**: Identify key decision points where ethical review should occur
2. **Review Process**: Define who will conduct reviews and how
3. **Documentation Requirements**: Specify what will be documented about ethical considerations
4. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Create channels for stakeholders to raise concerns
5. **Adaptation Process**: Define how the system will adapt to address emerging ethical issues

### Part 6: Reflection and Synthesis

Write a 1000-1500 word ethical impact assessment report that includes:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the project and key ethical considerations
2. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Summary of stakeholders and their interests
3. **Key Ethical Considerations**: Analysis of the most significant ethical dimensions
4. **Risk Assessment**: Summary of major risks and mitigation strategies
5. **Governance Framework**: Overview of ongoing ethical governance
6. **Recommendations**: Specific recommendations for project implementation
7. **Limitations**: Acknowledgment of limitations in the assessment

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, reflect on the following questions:

1. How did conducting a systematic ethical impact assessment change your perspective on the project?

2. What ethical considerations were you most likely to overlook without this structured approach?

3. How could this type of assessment be integrated into regular development processes without creating excessive overhead?

4. What tensions did you observe between different ethical principles or stakeholder interests?

5. How did considering the role of AI assistance in development affect your ethical analysis compared to traditional development?

## Extension Activities

1. **Peer Review**: Exchange ethical impact assessments with colleagues and provide feedback on each other's analyses.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Interview or survey representatives of key stakeholder groups to validate your assumptions about their interests and concerns.

3. **Implementation Planning**: Create a detailed implementation plan for your top three mitigation strategies.

4. **Temporal Analysis**: Extend your assessment to consider how ethical considerations might evolve over the entire lifecycle of the system, from development through deployment and eventual decommissioning.

## Submission

Submit your completed ethical impact assessment report along with brief answers to the reflection questions.
