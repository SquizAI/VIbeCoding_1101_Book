# Ninja Exercise 3: Case Study Development

## Overview

This ninja-level exercise challenges you to develop a comprehensive, research-based case study of an ethical challenge in AI-assisted development. Unlike simpler exercises that introduce concepts, this exercise requires deep investigation, original research, nuanced analysis, and the development of teaching materials based on your findings.

## Objectives

- Identify and investigate a significant ethical challenge in AI-assisted development
- Conduct comprehensive research including interviews, document analysis, and historical review
- Develop a nuanced, multi-stakeholder analysis of complex ethical dimensions
- Create a teaching case study with supporting materials for education and training
- Transform real-world experience into actionable knowledge for the community

## Exercise

### Part 1: Topic Selection and Research Plan

Begin by selecting a significant ethical challenge and developing a comprehensive research plan:

1. **Topic Identification**
   - Select one of the following ethical challenge areas (or propose your own):
     - **Bias amplification**: How AI assistance magnifies existing biases in development
     - **Agency degradation**: Loss of developer understanding and control
     - **Responsibility diffusion**: Unclear accountability between AI and human
     - **Intellectual property complexities**: Ownership and attribution issues
     - **Transparency failures**: Unexplainable or opaque development processes
     - **Privacy implications**: Unintended data exposures through AI-assisted code
     - **Skill displacement**: Changing skill requirements and developer roles
     - **Power concentration**: Shifts in influence and control within teams

2. **Research Question Formulation**
   - Develop precise research questions, such as:
     - How does AI-assisted development affect accountability distribution in safety-critical systems?
     - What mechanisms cause transparency to degrade when teams scale AI usage?
     - How do different organizational models affect developer agency in AI-assisted environments?
     - What factors determine whether AI assistance amplifies or mitigates existing biases?

3. **Research Methodology Design**
   - Create a comprehensive research plan including:
     - **Data sources**: Documents, interviews, observations, surveys
     - **Participant selection**: Key stakeholders to include
     - **Analysis approach**: How you'll synthesize findings
     - **Validation strategy**: How you'll verify conclusions
     - **Ethical considerations**: How you'll conduct research ethically

**Sample Research Plan Component:**

**Research Questions for Agency Degradation Case Study:**
1. How does the introduction of AI assistance change developers' understanding of their codebase?
2. What specific practices correlate with maintained versus diminished agency?
3. How do different types of AI interactions affect long-term skill development?
4. What organizational factors influence the agency impact of AI adoption?

**Methodology Approach:**
- Semi-structured interviews with 12-15 developers across experience levels
- Document analysis of code before and after AI assistance adoption
- Observation of development sessions with and without AI
- Longitudinal survey of self-reported understanding and capability

### Part 2: Comprehensive Research Execution

Conduct your research according to your methodology plan:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather data through methods such as:
     - **Interviews**: Conduct structured discussions with key stakeholders
     - **Document analysis**: Review code, documentation, and communications
     - **Observation**: Directly observe development practices if possible
     - **Historical review**: Analyze changes over time
     - **Survey**: Collect broader perspectives if appropriate

2. **Analysis Execution**
   - Analyze your data through approaches such as:
     - Thematic analysis of qualitative data
     - Pattern identification across instances
     - Temporal analysis of developments over time
     - Stakeholder-based perspective analysis
     - Comparative assessment of different approaches

3. **Finding Synthesis**
   - Synthesize your analysis into structured findings:
     - Key themes and patterns
     - Causal relationships and mechanisms
     - Contextual factors and influences
     - Stakeholder perspectives and tensions
     - Successful and unsuccessful approaches

**Research Guidelines:**

While you may not be able to conduct actual interviews or observations, you can:
- Draw on your own professional experience
- Research published case studies and reports
- Analyze open source projects with visible AI assistance
- Study organizational policies and practices
- Examine public discussions and community forums

If using real organizations or projects, consider anonymizing details as appropriate.

### Part 3: Case Study Development

Transform your research into a comprehensive case study:

1. **Narrative Development**
   - Create a detailed narrative (1500-2500 words) that includes:
     - **Context**: Background, organizations, technologies
     - **Challenge**: The central ethical problem and its emergence
     - **Stakeholders**: Key actors and their perspectives
     - **Decision points**: Critical choices and their implications
     - **Outcomes**: Results of different approaches
     - **Lessons**: Key insights and transferable knowledge

2. **Analysis Section**
   - Develop a thorough analysis (1000-1500 words) including:
     - **Ethical dimensions**: Principles and values at stake
     - **Tension mapping**: Competing considerations
     - **Root causes**: Underlying factors creating the challenge
     - **Contextual factors**: How environment shaped outcomes
     - **Alternative paths**: Other approaches that could have been taken

3. **Teaching Materials**
   - Create materials to support learning from your case:
     - **Discussion questions**: Prompts for exploring key aspects
     - **Teaching notes**: Guidance for instructors using the case
