# Chapter 11 Examples: Ethics in AI-Assisted Development

This directory contains practical examples illustrating ethical considerations in AI-assisted development. These examples provide concrete scenarios to help you understand how ethical principles apply in real-world development contexts.

## Ethical Frameworks

- [Ethical Decision-Making Framework](ethical_decision_framework.md) - A structured approach to making ethical decisions when working with AI coding assistants.

- [Bounded Agency Model](bounded_agency_model.md) - A framework for maintaining developer agency while leveraging AI assistance.

- [Transparency Matrix](transparency_matrix.md) - A method for evaluating and enhancing the transparency of AI-assisted development processes.

## Case Studies

- [Bias Identification Case Study](bias_identification_case.md) - A real-world example of identifying and addressing bias in AI-generated code.

- [Transparency Challenge](transparency_challenge.md) - A case study on improving explainability in complex AI-assisted development.

- [Developer Agency Dilemma](agency_dilemma.md) - A scenario exploring the tension between productivity and maintaining developer agency.

- [Responsible Implementation Example](responsible_implementation.md) - A successful application of ethical principles in enterprise development.

## Practical Tools

- [Ethical Review Checklist](ethical_review_checklist.md) - A comprehensive checklist for reviewing AI-generated code from an ethical perspective.

- [Bias Detection Techniques](bias_detection_techniques.md) - Practical methods for identifying potential biases in AI-generated code.

- [Responsible Prompting Patterns](responsible_prompting_patterns.md) - Patterns for crafting prompts that encourage ethical code generation.

- [Explainability Enhancement Strategies](explainability_strategies.md) - Techniques to make AI-assisted development more transparent and understandable.

Each example includes detailed explanations, code samples where appropriate, and guidance for applying the concepts in your own development work.
