# Ethical Review Checklist

## Overview

This comprehensive checklist provides a structured approach for reviewing AI-generated code from an ethical perspective. It helps developers identify potential ethical issues across multiple dimensions and ensures that AI-assisted development aligns with responsible development practices.

## How to Use This Checklist

1. **When to Apply**: Use this checklist when reviewing significant AI-generated or AI-assisted code before integration, particularly for code that:
   - Processes user data
   - Makes decisions affecting users
   - Implements core business logic
   - Will be difficult to change later

2. **Review Process**:
   - Complete all sections relevant to your code
   - Document findings and necessary actions
   - Prioritize issues based on severity and impact
   - Create specific follow-up tasks for identified concerns

3. **Integration with Development**:
   - Incorporate this checklist into your code review process
   - Reference specific checklist items in review comments
   - Track recurring issues to improve AI prompting
   - Use findings to enhance team awareness of ethical considerations

## Example Application: User Scoring System

### Context
The following is an ethical review of an AI-generated user scoring system for a financial application.

### Code Snippet (for illustration)
```python
def calculate_user_score(user_data, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG):
    """Calculate user reliability score based on profile data."""
    base_score = 0
    
    # Education score component
    if user_data.education_level in ['graduate', 'postgraduate']:
        base_score += 20
    elif user_data.education_level == 'undergraduate':
        base_score += 15
    elif user_data.education_level == 'high_school':
        base_score += 5
    
    # Stability score component
    if user_data.address_years > 3:
        base_score += 15
    else:
        base_score += int(user_data.address_years * 5)
    
    # Location adjustment
    zip_prefix = user_data.zip_code[:3]
    if zip_prefix in HIGH_INCOME_AREAS:
        base_score += 10
    elif zip_prefix in LOW_INCOME_AREAS:
        base_score -= 5
    
    # Activity adjustment
    if user_data.login_frequency > 15:
        base_score += 10
    elif user_data.login_frequency < 5:
        base_score -= 10
    
    # Apply age curve
    age_factor = 1.0
    if user_data.age < 25:
        age_factor = 0.85
    elif user_data.age > 60:
        age_factor = 0.9
    
    final_score = min(int(base_score * age_factor), 100)
    
    return {
        'score': final_score,
        'category': get_score_category(final_score),
        'generated_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

### Sample Review Findings

#### Fairness and Bias Review:
- **Critical Issue**: ZIP code used as a factor with explicit high/low income area lists creates likely socioeconomic and racial bias
- **High Issue**: Education level weighting creates disadvantage for those with limited educational access
- **High Issue**: Age penalties for younger and older users may constitute age discrimination
- **Medium Issue**: Address stability penalizes those who move frequently, potentially disadvantaging certain groups

#### Transparency Review:
- **High Issue**: No explanation for how score categories are determined
- **Medium Issue**: No documentation of the rationale behind weighting factors
- **Medium Issue**: No clear indication to users about factors influencing their score

#### Accountability Review:
- **High Issue**: No logging or audit trail for score calculations
- **Medium Issue**: No mechanism for users to appeal or correct information

#### Benefit and Harm Review:
- **High Issue**: Potential to reinforce existing inequalities in financial access
- **Medium Issue**: No clear proportionality between factors and score impact

### Sample Action Items:
1. **Remove ZIP code factor** or replace with more directly relevant variables (Critical, Developer Team, Before deployment)
2. **Revise education weighting** to reduce bias against those with limited educational opportunities (High, Algorithm Team, Before deployment)
3. **Remove age penalties** or justify with specific risk data (High, Policy Team, Before deployment)
4. **Add explanation capability** to provide users with information about score factors (High, UX Team, First update)
5. **Implement appeal process** for users to contest scores (Medium, Product Team, Second update)

### Sample Summary:
The AI-generated scoring system contains several significant ethical issues, particularly related to bias and fairness. While the structure of the code is clear, the underlying assumptions and weightings embed problematic social biases. The system requires substantial revision before deployment, focusing particularly on removing socioeconomic proxies and ensuring fair treatment across age groups.

## Conclusion

Ethical review of AI-generated code should be a standard part of the development process. This checklist provides a comprehensive framework for identifying and addressing ethical concerns across multiple dimensions. By systematically evaluating code against these criteria, developers can ensure that AI-assisted development aligns with ethical principles and responsible development practices.

Remember that ethical review is not a one-time activity but should be integrated throughout the development lifecycle. Use this checklist to guide initial reviews, but also revisit ethical considerations as code evolves and as you gain new insights into its real-world impact.
