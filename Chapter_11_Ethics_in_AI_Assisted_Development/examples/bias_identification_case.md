# Case Study: Identifying and Addressing Bias in AI-Generated Code

## Background

In late 2024, a mid-sized financial technology company was developing a customer qualification system for their lending platform. The development team was leveraging an AI coding assistant to accelerate development. This case study examines how the team identified and addressed potential biases in the AI-generated code.

## The Project

The system was designed to make preliminary assessments of loan applicants based on their financial history and other relevant factors. The development team used an AI assistant to generate much of the data processing logic and scoring algorithms.

## The Challenge

During a regular code review, a junior developer noticed something concerning about the AI-generated qualification algorithm. While the code itself appeared functionally sound, they identified several potential sources of bias that could lead to unfair treatment of certain applicant groups.

## Bias Identification

The team conducted a thorough analysis and identified several sources of potential bias:

### 1. Proxy Variables

The AI had generated code that used seemingly neutral variables that could serve as proxies for protected characteristics:

- Using zip code as a heavily weighted factor (potential proxy for race/ethnicity)
- Penalizing gaps in employment history (potential discrimination against caregivers, often women)
- Overemphasis on traditional credit scoring (disadvantaging younger applicants and immigrants)

### 2. Data Processing Assumptions

The generated code included assumptions about "normal" financial behaviors that reflected majority patterns:

- Prioritizing consistent income from traditional employment
- Undervaluing alternative financial histories common in certain communities
- Assuming regular, predictable expense patterns

### 3. Threshold Implementation

The AI had implemented hard thresholds that could create arbitrary cutoffs:

- Binary pass/fail determinations rather than nuanced risk assessments
- Fixed minimum income requirements without context
- Rigid debt-to-income ratio cutoffs

## Response Strategy

The team implemented the following strategies to address the identified biases:

### 1. Algorithmic Remediation

They modified the algorithm to:

- Reduce reliance on location-based factors
- Implement more flexible evaluation of employment history
- Consider alternative measures of financial responsibility
- Replace hard thresholds with weighted risk factors

### 2. Process Improvements

The team implemented process changes:

- Created a bias identification checklist specific to financial applications
- Established a regular equity review process for all AI-generated code
- Diversified the review team to include perspectives from various backgrounds
- Documented all bias concerns and mitigations for future reference

### 3. AI Assistant Prompting

The team refined their prompting approach:

- Explicitly included fairness requirements in prompts
- Included diversity and equity considerations in requirements specifications
- Requested explanations of potential bias concerns from the AI assistant
- Asked for alternative implementations that might reduce bias

## Results

After implementing these changes, the team:

1. Produced a more equitable qualification system that maintained accuracy while reducing potential discrimination
2. Developed stronger practices for working with AI coding assistants in sensitive domains
3. Created a case study and training materials to help other teams identify similar issues
4. Established an ongoing monitoring system to evaluate any disparate impact once the system was deployed

## Key Lessons

1. **Proactive bias identification** is necessary when using AI-generated code, particularly for sensitive applications.

2. **Diverse review teams** are more effective at identifying potential biases that might otherwise go unnoticed.

3. **Explicit fairness requirements** should be included in prompts to AI coding assistants.

4. **Domain-specific bias checklists** are valuable tools for developers using AI assistants.

5. **Documentation of bias concerns and mitigations** helps build institutional knowledge and improved practices.

## Discussion Questions

1. What structural changes could development teams make to ensure bias identification becomes a standard part of the development process?

2. How might AI assistants themselves be improved to help identify potential biases in the code they generate?

3. What responsibility do individual developers have to develop bias identification skills when working with AI coding assistants?

4. How can organizations balance efficiency gains from AI assistants with the need for careful ethical review?

5. What metrics would be appropriate for evaluating the success of bias mitigation efforts in practice?
