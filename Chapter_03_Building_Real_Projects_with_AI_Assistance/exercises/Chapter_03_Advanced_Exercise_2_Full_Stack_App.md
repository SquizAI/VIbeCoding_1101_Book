## üéØ Objective

Design and implement a complete full-stack application using AI assistance throughout the entire development lifecycle, leveraging modern architecture patterns and best practices.

## üìù Description

In this advanced exercise, you'll build a feature-complete task management application with a robust backend API and an interactive frontend. You'll use AI to help with architecture decisions, API design, database modeling, frontend implementation, testing strategies, and performance optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Requirements

Your full-stack application should include:

### Backend Requirements:
1. RESTful API with proper resource modeling
2. User authentication and authorization
3. Database integration with appropriate schema design
4. Input validation and error handling
5. Unit and integration tests
6. API documentation

### Frontend Requirements:
1. Modern UI with component-based architecture
2. State management solution
3. Form handling with validation
4. Data fetching and caching strategy
5. Responsive design
6. Loading and error states

## üîç Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Architecture & Planning

Leverage AI to help with the system design:

```
Prompt: "I'm planning a full-stack task management application. Help me design the architecture by:

1. Suggesting a modern tech stack for both frontend and backend
2. Designing the key entities and relationships for the database model
3. Outlining the main API endpoints needed
4. Proposing a component architecture for the frontend
5. Recommending state management approaches
6. Suggesting deployment options"
```

### Phase 2: Backend Development

#### API Design:

```
Prompt: "Based on our task management application architecture, help me design a comprehensive RESTful API by:

1. Specifying the complete resource hierarchy with proper naming
2. Detailing request/response formats for each endpoint
3. Defining authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. Outlining error handling strategies
5. Suggesting pagination, filtering, and sorting approaches
6. Creating a sample OpenAPI specification for the tasks resource"
```

#### Database Implementation:

```
Prompt: "I need to implement the database for my task management app. Please help with:

1. Creating the complete schema with all tables, fields, and relationships
2. Writing migration scripts
3. Defining indexes for performance optimization
4. Implementing the repository/data access layer
5. Setting up proper validation rules
6. Adding seed data for development"
```

#### Authentication System:

```
Prompt: "For my task management app, I need to implement a secure authentication system. Please provide:

1. Implementation for user registration, login, and password reset
2. JWT token generation and validation
3. Role-based authorization middleware
4. Password hashing with proper security practices
5. Session management strategies
6. Protection against common authentication vulnerabilities"
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

#### Component Architecture:

```
Prompt: "I'm building the frontend for my task management app using [your chosen framework]. Help me implement:

1. A component hierarchy diagram for the application
2. Reusable UI components (navigation, task list, task card, etc.)
3. Layout components with responsive design
4. State management setup (context, redux, etc.)
5. Routing configuration
6. Global styling and theming"
```

#### Data Fetching & State Management:

```
Prompt: "For my task management frontend, I need to implement data fetching and state management. Please provide:

1. API client configuration with authentication handling
2. Data fetching hooks for all API resources
3. Caching strategy implementation
4. Loading and error state handling
5. Optimistic updates for better UX
6. State normalization approach for complex data"
```

#### Advanced UI Features:

```
Prompt: "I want to add some advanced UI features to my task management app. Please help me implement:

1. Drag-and-drop for task reordering
2. Infinite scrolling for task lists
3. Rich text editing for task descriptions
4. Date picker for deadlines with recurring options
5. Task filtering and search functionality
6. Dark/light theme switching"
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance

```
Prompt: "I need comprehensive testing for my task management application. Please provide:

1. Backend unit tests for core business logic
2. API integration tests for all endpoints
3. Frontend component tests with mocked data
4. End-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Performance test strategy and implementation
6. Security testing approach"
```

### Phase 5: Deployment & DevOps

```
Prompt: "I'm ready to deploy my task management application. Help me with:

1. Containerization with Docker
2. CI/CD pipeline configuration
3. Environment variable management
4. Database migration strategies for production
5. Monitoring and logging setup
6. Backup and disaster recovery plan"
```

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

Your full-stack application will be evaluated on:

1. **Architecture Quality**: Clean separation of concerns, proper layering
2. **Code Quality**: Well-structured, readable, and maintainable code
3. **Feature Completeness**: All required features implemented
4. **Security**: Proper authentication, authorization, and data protection
5. **Performance**: Optimized database queries, frontend rendering
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
7. **UI/UX**: Intuitive interface with good user experience
8. **Documentation**: Clear documentation for API and codebase

## üìù Submission Guidelines

Document your process with:

1. Architecture diagrams and design decisions
2. API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
3. Database schema
4. Source code with clear organization
5. README with setup instructions
6. Deployment instructions
7. A reflection on how AI assisted your development process

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use an iterative approach**: Start with core features and expand
2. **Leverage AI for boilerplate code**: Save time on repetitive tasks
3. **Ask AI to review your code**: Get feedback on your implementation
4. **Be specific about your tech stack**: Mention your chosen technologies in prompts
5. **Consider scalability**: Design with potential growth in mind
6. **Document as you go**: Keep track of design decisions and rationale

## üåü Bonus Challenges
