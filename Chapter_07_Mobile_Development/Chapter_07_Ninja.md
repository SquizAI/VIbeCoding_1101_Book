## Cutting-Edge Mobile Architectures

### Declarative UI Architectures

Beyond traditional component-based architectures lie fully declarative approaches:

#### 1. Server-Driven UI

Server-driven UI architectures allow dynamic interface updates without app releases:

```
I need to implement a server-driven UI system where:
1. UI structure is defined by JSON schemas delivered from the backend
2. Components are rendered dynamically based on these schemas
3. Business logic can be updated remotely
4. Validation and safety mechanisms prevent malicious payloads
5. Fallback patterns handle schema version mismatches
6. Performance optimizations prevent rendering delays
```

#### 2. SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose Integration

Integrate declarative UI frameworks in cross-platform applications:

```
I'm building a cross-platform app with React Native but need to use native declarative UI frameworks for critical sections:
1. SwiftUI components for iOS-specific features
2. Jetpack Compose for Android-specific features
3. Bridging mechanism between React Native and native code
4. Consistent state management across boundaries
5. Shared theme system that works in all environments
```

### Micro-Frontend Architecture for Mobile

Apply micro-frontend principles to mobile applications:

```
I need to architect a large-scale mobile app using micro-frontend principles where:
1. Different teams own different features independently
2. Features can be developed, tested, and deployed in isolation
3. Common services and design systems are shared
4. Navigation between micro-frontends is seamless
5. Performance remains optimized despite the distributed architecture
6. Feature flags control the visibility of new features
```
