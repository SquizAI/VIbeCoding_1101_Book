## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, your team will create a comprehensive prompt library that serves as a shared resource for effective AI interactions. This library will standardize how team members communicate with AI assistants, improving consistency, quality, and knowledge sharing across your organization.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Understand the principles of effective prompt design for team contexts
- Learn how to categorize and organize prompts for different development tasks
- Develop skills in creating reusable, parameterized prompt templates
- Establish version control and documentation practices for prompt management
- Create a system for collaborative improvement of prompts over time

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of prompt engineering concepts
- Familiarity with version control systems (Git)
- Access to an AI assistant for testing prompts

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Team Workflows (30 minutes)

1. Identify 5-10 common development tasks in your team that involve AI assistance
   - Code generation (components, functions, algorithms)
   - Debugging and troubleshooting
   - Architecture and design decisions
   - Documentation and commenting
   - Testing and quality assurance

2. For each task, document:
   - The goal of the AI interaction
   - Current ad-hoc prompting approaches used by team members
   - Common variations and edge cases
   - Success criteria for the interaction

### Step 2: Design Prompt Categories and Structure (45 minutes)

1. Create a hierarchical structure for your prompt library:

   - **Code Generation**
     - Components
     - Functions
     - Algorithms
     - Data Transformations
   - **Debugging**
     - Error Analysis
     - Performance Issues
     - Security Vulnerabilities
   - **Architecture**
     - System Design
     - Pattern Selection
     - Technology Evaluation
   - **Documentation**
     - Code Comments
     - API Docs
     - User Guides
   - **Testing**
     - Test Generation
     - Edge Cases
     - Quality Assurance

2. For each category, define:
   - Common parameters that prompts in this category need
   - Shared structural elements
   - Standard output formats

### Step 3: Develop Prompt Templates (1.5 hours)

1. Create at least one detailed prompt template for each major category
2. Format each template using the CRISPER framework:
   - **Context**: Background information the AI needs
   - **Requirements**: What you need the AI to accomplish
   - **Implementation Scope**: Boundaries of what to generate
   - **Specific Constraints**: Technologies, patterns, standards to follow
   - **Prior Examples**: Snippets of existing code or desired patterns
   - **Expected Output**: Format and structure of desired result
   - **Review Criteria**: How to evaluate the output

3. Include parameters in your templates using a consistent syntax:
   ```
   [parameter_name]
   ```

### Step 4: Create Documentation and Usage Guidelines (45 minutes)

1. Create a README.md for your prompt library with:
   - Purpose and benefits of the library
   - Structure and organization
   - How to use templates
   - How to contribute improvements

2. For each prompt template, include:
   - Use cases and examples
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Example results
   - Version history with dates and changes

3. Develop guidelines for:
   - When to use which prompt
   - How to customize prompts for specific needs
   - How to test prompt effectiveness
   - How to propose improvements

### Step 5: Implement Version Control and Collaboration (30 minutes)

1. Set up your prompt library in a version-controlled repository
2. Establish a contribution workflow:
   - How to propose new prompts
   - Review process for prompt additions/changes
   - Testing requirements for prompt modifications
   - Release and notification process for updates

3. Create a simple change log template for tracking prompt evolution

### Step 6: Test and Refine (1 hour)

1. Test each prompt template with at least three different parameter sets
2. Document the results and effectiveness
3. Gather feedback from team members
4. Refine prompts based on testing and feedback
5. Create A/B test comparisons for different prompt variations

### Step 7: Create an Onboarding Guide (30 minutes)

1. Develop materials to help team members adopt the prompt library
2. Create a quick reference guide for common scenarios
3. Document "before and after" examples showing improvement over ad-hoc prompting

## Deliverables

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

1. A structured prompt library with at least 5-8 well-documented prompt templates
2. A comprehensive README with usage guidelines
3. Individual documentation for each prompt template
4. A version control strategy for managing the prompt library
5. Test results demonstrating the effectiveness of your prompts
6. An onboarding guide for team adoption

## Extension Activities

1. **Prompt Effectiveness Metrics**: Develop a system for measuring and tracking prompt success rates
2. **Parameterized Template System**: Create a simple tool that helps fill in template parameters
3. **Prompt Chaining**: Design multi-step prompt sequences for complex tasks
4. **Specialized Domain Libraries**: Create sub-libraries for specific technical domains
5. **Prompt Sharing Portal**: Set up a team portal for browsing and using the prompt library

## Discussion Questions

1. How does having standardized prompts improve team productivity?
2. What patterns did you notice across effective prompts for different tasks?
3. How might you measure the ROI of investing in a prompt library?
4. What governance considerations are important for maintaining prompt quality?
5. How should prompt libraries evolve as AI capabilities advance?
