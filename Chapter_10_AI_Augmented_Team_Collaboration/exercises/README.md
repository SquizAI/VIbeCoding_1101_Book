## Overview

This directory contains hands-on exercises to reinforce the concepts covered in Chapter 10: AI-Augmented Team Collaboration. Each exercise is designed to provide practical experience with different aspects of effectively integrating AI assistance into team workflows.

## Exercise List

1. [Exercise 1: Team Prompt Library](./exercise_1_prompt_library.md)
   - Create a shared collection of effective prompts for common development tasks
   - Establish templates and standards for team-wide AI interactions
   - Implement a process for continuous improvement of shared prompts

2. [Exercise 2: Collaborative Workflow Design](./exercise_2_workflow_design.md)
   - Analyze current team workflows to identify AI integration opportunities
   - Design optimized collaborative processes leveraging AI capabilities
   - Implement and test new workflows with appropriate metrics

3. [Exercise 3: Knowledge Management System](./exercise_3_knowledge_management.md)
   - Design a team knowledge architecture incorporating AI assistance
   - Implement processes for automated knowledge capture and organization
   - Create interfaces for efficient knowledge retrieval and application

4. [Exercise 4: Multi-Agent Collaboration](./exercise_4_multi_agent.md)
   - Design specialized AI agent roles for different team functions
   - Create coordination mechanisms for multi-agent collaboration
   - Implement human oversight and direction within agent networks

## How to Use These Exercises

Each exercise includes:
- Detailed instructions and objectives
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Discussion questions for team reflection
- Extension activities for advanced exploration

These exercises are designed to be completed by development teams working together, though individuals can also benefit from working through them independently. The best results come from applying these concepts to real-world team scenarios and adapting them to your specific context.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of AI assistant capabilities
- Familiarity with software development workflows
- Access to AI tools that support collaborative interaction
