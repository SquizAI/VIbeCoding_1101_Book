# Beginner Exercise 2: Problem Framing Exercise

## Overview

As AI assistants become more capable, a developer's ability to clearly frame problems becomes increasingly important. This exercise focuses on developing your skill in articulating problems in ways that lead to optimal AI-assisted solutions.

## Objectives

- Practice framing problems at different levels of abstraction
- Develop skill in identifying the core aspects of a development challenge
- Learn to communicate constraints and requirements effectively
- Understand how problem framing affects AI-generated solutions

## Exercise

### Part 1: Problem Collection

Identify three different programming or development problems you've recently encountered:
- A simple utility function or algorithm
- A moderate UI/UX challenge
- A complex system integration or architecture issue

For each problem, write down your initial, intuitive description as if you were explaining it to a colleague.

### Part 2: Multi-level Framing

For each problem, reframe it at three different levels:

**Implementation Level**
- Focus on specific code or technical details
- Include specific technologies, libraries, or patterns to be used
- Describe the input/output or behavior expectations in concrete terms

**Conceptual Level**
- Focus on the problem in terms of concepts and relationships
- Abstract away specific technologies
- Describe what needs to be accomplished rather than how

**Intent Level**
- Focus on the underlying goal or purpose
- Describe the user or business need being addressed
- Articulate the value that a solution would provide

### Part 3: Constraint Mapping

For each problem:
1. Identify all relevant constraints (performance, compatibility, security, etc.)
2. Classify each constraint as either:
   - Critical (must be satisfied)
   - Important (should be satisfied if possible)
   - Preferable (nice to have)
3. Describe how each constraint affects the solution space

### Part 4: AI Collaboration

1. Take one of your problems and create three different prompts for an AI assistant:
   - A prompt focused on implementation details
   - A prompt focused on conceptual understanding
   - A prompt focused on intent and value
   
2. Submit each prompt to your preferred AI coding assistant.

3. Compare the responses and analyze:
   - How did the different framings affect the solutions?
   - Which framing produced the most useful response?
   - What aspects of the problem did each framing emphasize or miss?

### Part 5: Reflection

Consider the following questions:
1. Which level of framing do you naturally gravitate toward?
2. How does your preferred framing affect your interactions with AI tools?
3. In what situations would each level of framing be most appropriate?
4. How might you combine different framing levels in a single prompt?
5. How do you think problem framing will evolve as AI assistants become more capable?

## Outcomes

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Consciously frame problems at different levels of abstraction
- Choose the most appropriate framing based on the context and goals
- Communicate more effectively with AI assistants
- Develop a meta-awareness of your own problem-solving approach

## Extension Ideas

- Create a personal "framing template" with prompts to help you frame problems more effectively
- Experiment with hybrid framings that combine elements from different levels
- Practice translating other people's problem statements into different framing levels
- Develop a "framing checklist" to ensure you've considered key aspects of a problem
