# Beginner Exercise 1: Multimodal Prompt Practice

## Overview

As AI assistants evolve to handle multiple forms of input beyond text, developers need to become skilled at combining different modalities to express their intent clearly. This exercise helps you practice creating comprehensive multimodal specifications.

## Objectives

- Develop skills in expressing requirements through multiple modalities
- Practice combining text, visual, and conceptual elements in specifications
- Learn to identify which requirements are best expressed through each modality

## Exercise

### Part 1: Select a Feature

Choose a moderately complex feature that you might want to implement in an application. Some suggestions:
- A dashboard for monitoring system metrics
- A multi-step user registration flow
- A content management interface
- A data visualization component

### Part 2: Create a Comprehensive Multimodal Specification

Create a specification for your feature that includes:

1. **Text Description (500-800 words)**
   - Describe the purpose and functionality of the feature
   - Explain the user needs it addresses
   - Detail the core requirements and constraints

2. **Visual Elements**
   - Sketch or diagram the user interface
   - Create a flow chart showing user interactions
   - Draw entity relationship diagrams if applicable
   - Create mock visualizations of expected data representations

3. **Examples and Scenarios**
   - Describe 3-5 concrete usage scenarios
   - Provide examples of expected inputs and outputs
   - Include edge cases and how they should be handled

4. **Context and Constraints**
   - Define performance requirements
   - List accessibility considerations
   - Specify device and browser compatibility
   - Note integration points with other systems

### Part 3: Reflection

After completing your multimodal specification, reflect on the following questions:

1. Which aspects of the feature were easier to express through text? Which were easier to express visually?

2. How does combining different modalities create a more complete specification than using just one modality?

3. What ambiguities remain in your specification that would require further clarification?

4. How might a multimodal AI assistant interpret your specification differently than a text-only assistant?

5. What challenges did you encounter when trying to express your intent across multiple modalities?

## Extension Activities

1. **Collaborative Refinement**: Share your specification with a colleague and ask them to identify any unclear elements. Refine your specification based on their feedback.

2. **Implementation Test**: If possible, use your specification to guide an implementation (either by yourself or using an AI assistant). Note where the specification was clear and where it needed further elaboration.

3. **Modality Comparison**: Create a text-only version of the same specification. Compare how comprehensive and clear it is relative to the multimodal version.

## Submission

Document your multimodal specification and reflection in a format that combines all elements (such as a PDF or digital notebook). Include any insights about how this approach might change your future interactions with AI development tools.
