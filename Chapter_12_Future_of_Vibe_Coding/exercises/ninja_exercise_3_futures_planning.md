4. **Uncertainty Identification**
   - Identify critical uncertainties that could significantly affect future trajectories
   - Analyze potential inflection points and tipping factors
   - Document range-of-possibility for key variables

### Part 2: Scenario Development

Create detailed scenarios depicting different possible futures of AI-assisted development:

1. **Scenario Framework**
   - Select 2-3 critical uncertainties as scenario axes
   - Create a scenario matrix showing distinct future states
   - Identify key characteristics of each scenario quadrant

2. **Scenario Narratives**
   - Develop detailed narratives for 3-4 distinct scenarios
   - For each scenario, describe:
     - The state of AI capabilities and human-AI collaboration
     - The development practices and methodologies that dominate
     - The economic and organizational structures around development
     - The skill sets and roles that are most valued
     - The challenges and opportunities present in this future

3. **Artifact Creation**
   - For each scenario, create artifacts from that future:
     - Job descriptions for key roles
     - Screenshots or mockups of development environments
     - Snippets of documentation or training materials
     - Descriptions of typical development workflows
     - Examples of metrics and success criteria

4. **Timeline Construction**
   - For each scenario, create a timeline from present to future state
   - Identify key events, developments, and turning points
   - Document causal relationships between developments

### Part 3: Opportunity Mapping

Identify strategic opportunities across your scenarios:

1. **Opportunity Spaces**
   - For each scenario, identify 3-5 major opportunity spaces
   - Analyze which opportunity spaces appear across multiple scenarios
   - Assess the potential value and accessibility of each opportunity

2. **Capability Assessment**
   - Identify capabilities required to capture each opportunity
   - Analyze which capabilities apply across multiple scenarios
   - Assess the development path for these capabilities

3. **Vulnerability Analysis**
   - Identify potential vulnerabilities in each scenario
   - Analyze which vulnerabilities appear across multiple scenarios
   - Assess strategies for mitigating these vulnerabilities

4. **Positioning Strategy**
   - Develop approaches for positioning in each scenario
   - Identify positioning strategies that work across scenarios
