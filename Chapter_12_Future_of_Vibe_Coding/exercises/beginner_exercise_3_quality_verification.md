# Beginner Exercise 3: Quality Verification Planning

## Overview

As AI tools handle more of the implementation details, developers need stronger skills in verifying quality, correctness, and alignment with requirements. This exercise helps you develop a systematic approach to verification in AI-assisted development.

## Objectives

- Develop strategies for verifying AI-generated code
- Create multi-dimensional quality assessment frameworks
- Practice identifying potential failure modes and edge cases
- Learn to balance verification effort with development speed

## Exercise

### Part 1: Verification Dimensions

Consider a recent development task where you used (or could have used) AI assistance. Identify at least five different quality dimensions that need verification, such as:
- Functional correctness
- Performance/efficiency
- Security considerations
- Edge case handling
- Maintainability
- Compatibility
- Accessibility
- User experience

For each dimension, write a brief description of what "good quality" looks like in this specific context.

### Part 2: Verification Methods

For each quality dimension you identified, develop at least two different methods to verify that dimension. Consider:

**Automated Approaches**
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Load/performance tests
- Static analysis
- Security scanning
- Automated accessibility checks

**Manual Approaches**
- Code review
- User testing
- Expert evaluation
- Documentation review
- Scenario walkthrough
- Paired programming validation

Create a table mapping each quality dimension to your chosen verification methods.

### Part 3: Risk-Based Prioritization

1. For your development task, assess the risk level (High/Medium/Low) for each quality dimension based on:
   - Impact of failure
   - Likelihood of issues
   - Complexity of implementation

2. Create a verification plan that allocates more attention to high-risk dimensions
   - For high-risk dimensions: comprehensive verification
   - For medium-risk dimensions: standard verification
   - For low-risk dimensions: basic verification

3. Estimate the time/effort required for each verification activity and prioritize accordingly.

### Part 4: AI-Specific Verification

Create a checklist specifically for verifying AI-generated code, including:

1. Common AI code generation weaknesses (e.g., hallucinated functions, outdated patterns)
2. Security vulnerabilities that AI systems might introduce
3. Verification that the AI correctly understood the requirements
4. Checks for unwanted side effects or dependencies
5. Assessment of code quality and best practices

### Part 5: Verification in Practice

Select a small piece of AI-generated code (or generate one for this exercise) and apply your verification approach:

1. Identify the relevant quality dimensions
2. Apply your verification methods
3. Document any issues found
4. Consider how you would address these issues:
   - By modifying the code directly
   - By revising your prompts and regenerating
   - Through a combination of both approaches

### Part 6: Reflection

Consider the following questions:
1. How does your verification approach for AI-generated code differ from traditional verification?
2. What patterns or issues did you notice during verification?
3. How might verification strategies evolve as AI code generation becomes more sophisticated?
4. What is the optimal balance between generation speed and verification thoroughness?
5. How could you design your development process to make verification more efficient?

## Outcomes

After completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Systematically verify AI-generated code across multiple quality dimensions
- Prioritize verification efforts based on risk assessment
- Identify common issues in AI-generated solutions
- Develop efficient verification workflows for AI-assisted development

## Extension Ideas

- Create a reusable verification template for different types of development tasks
- Develop a set of prompts specifically designed to help AI assist with verification
- Experiment with using AI to help verify code generated by other AI systems
- Create a library of test cases for common edge cases in your domain
