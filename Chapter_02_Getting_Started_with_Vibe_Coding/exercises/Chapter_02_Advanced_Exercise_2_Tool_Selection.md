## üéØ Objective

Learn how to evaluate and select the most appropriate AI tools for different coding tasks.

## üìù Instructions

1. For each of the following scenarios, identify which AI tool(s) would be most appropriate and why:

   a. **Scenario 1**: You need to quickly prototype a web application with a login system, dashboard, and data visualization components.
   
   b. **Scenario 2**: You're learning JavaScript and need help understanding how asynchronous functions work with practical examples.
   
   c. **Scenario 3**: You have an existing Python application and need to refactor it to improve performance.
   
   d. **Scenario 4**: You need to generate unit tests for a complex class that handles payment processing.
   
   e. **Scenario 5**: You want to build a mobile app that works on both iOS and Android platforms.

2. For each scenario, provide:
   - The AI tool(s) you would choose
   - Why this tool is appropriate for the task
   - How you would prompt the tool for optimal results
   - Potential limitations or challenges you might face

3. Compare at least two different AI coding tools (e.g., ChatGPT vs. GitHub Copilot, Claude vs. Codeium, etc.) and analyze:
   - Strengths and weaknesses of each
   - Types of tasks where each excels
   - Integration capabilities with your workflow
   - Cost vs. benefit considerations

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

- Depth of understanding of various AI coding tools
- Appropriateness of tool selection for each scenario
- Quality of prompt strategies
- Thoroughness of comparative analysis

## üîÑ Reflection Questions

1. How does the choice of AI tool impact the development process and final product?
2. What factors are most important to consider when selecting an AI coding assistant?
3. How might your choice of tools change as a project evolves from prototype to production?
4. What ethical considerations should be taken into account when selecting AI tools?

## üåü Example Analysis

**Scenario:** Building a data visualization dashboard

**Tool Selection:** ChatGPT + D3.js library

**Rationale:** ChatGPT excels at generating scaffolding code and explaining complex visualization concepts. D3.js is a powerful library for custom visualizations that can be leveraged through specific prompts.

**Prompt Strategy:** "Generate a D3.js dashboard with three components: 1) A time-series line chart for financial data, 2) A filterable data table, and 3) A pie chart showing category distribution. Include responsive design and tooltips for each element. Explain each visualization component separately."

**Limitations:** May require iteration to fine-tune visualizations, and generated code might need optimization for large datasets.
