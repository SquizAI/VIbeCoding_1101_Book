## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to write clear, effective prompts that generate the code you need.

## 📝 Instructions

1. Choose one of the following simple projects:
   - A personal introduction webpage
   - A temperature converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit)
   - A random password generator

2. Before using any AI tool, write down:
   - What the program should do (functionality)
   - Any specific features you want to include
   - The preferred programming language
   - Any styling preferences (if applicable)

3. Craft a prompt that includes:
   - A clear description of what you want to build
   - Specific requirements or constraints
   - The programming language to use
   - Any frameworks or libraries to include

4. Test your prompt with an AI assistant (like ChatGPT, Claude, or GitHub Copilot).

5. Evaluate the results:
   - Did the AI generate code that matches your requirements?
   - If not, what was missing or incorrect?
   - How could you improve your prompt?

6. Refine your prompt and try again until you get satisfactory results.

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

- Clarity of your prompt
- Completeness of the generated code
- Functionality of the final solution
- Your analysis of the prompt effectiveness

## 🔄 Reflection Questions

1. What elements of your prompt seemed to have the most impact on the quality of the generated code?
2. What was missing from your initial prompt that you added in later versions?
3. How did specifying technical details affect the output?
4. What would you do differently in your next prompt?

## 🌟 Example

**Initial prompt:** "Make a temperature converter."

**Improved prompt:** "Create a web-based temperature converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Include input validation, a clean modern interface with a gradient background, and display the formula being used for the conversion. Add comments explaining how the JavaScript functions work."
