```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Customer Clicks Checkout] --> B[Your Server Creates Checkout Session]
    B --> C[Stripe Returns Session ID]
    C --> D[Client Redirects to Stripe Checkout]
    D --> E{Customer Completes Payment?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Redirect to Success Page]
    E -->|No| G[Redirect to Cancel Page]
    F --> H[Server Verifies Payment]
    H --> I[Fulfill Order/Subscription]
    
    style A fill:#d5e8d4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style I fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Server-side Implementation**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Application
    participant Stripe as Stripe API
    participant Client as Client
    
    Client->>App: Checkout Request
    App->>App: Prepare Checkout Details
    Note over App: Configure payment methods,<br>line items, pricing,<br>subscription settings
    App->>Stripe: Create Checkout Session
    Stripe-->>App: Return Session ID
    App-->>Client: Return Session ID
    
    style App fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Stripe fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Client fill:#d5e8d4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Client-side Implementation**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant StripeCheckout
    
    User->>Client: Click Checkout Button
    Client->>Server: Request Checkout Session
    Server-->>Client: Return Session ID
    Client->>StripeCheckout: Redirect with Session ID
    StripeCheckout->>User: Display Secure Payment Form
    User->>StripeCheckout: Enter Payment Details
    StripeCheckout->>Server: Confirm Payment (webhook)
    StripeCheckout->>Client: Redirect to Success/Cancel URL
    
    style User fill:#f9d5e5,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style StripeCheckout fill:#ffe6cc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
