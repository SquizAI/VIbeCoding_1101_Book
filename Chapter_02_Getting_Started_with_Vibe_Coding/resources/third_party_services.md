# Essential Third-Party Services for Modern App Development

This resource covers key third-party services, APIs, and protocols that will help you build robust applications for your capstone project. These services provide pre-built functionality that allows you to focus on your core application features rather than reinventing the wheel.

## Payment Processing Services

### Stripe

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is the industry standard for payment processing, offering:

- **Complete Payment Infrastructure**: Accept credit cards, digital wallets, and local payment methods
- **Subscription Management**: Recurring billing with smart retry logic
- **Fraud Prevention**: Advanced tools to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions
- **Developer-First API**: Clean, well-documented API with SDKs for all major languages
- **Checkout Components**: Pre-built UI components for payments

**Integration Flow**:

The Stripe integration process typically follows these steps:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Customer Clicks Checkout] --> B[Your Server Creates Checkout Session]
    B --> C[Stripe Returns Session ID]
    C --> D[Client Redirects to Stripe Checkout]
    D --> E{Customer Completes Payment?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Redirect to Success Page]
    E -->|No| G[Redirect to Cancel Page]
    F --> H[Server Verifies Payment]
    H --> I[Fulfill Order/Subscription]
```

**Server-side Implementation**:
On your server, you would create a checkout session by providing details like:
- Payment methods to accept (credit cards, etc.)
- Line items with product information and pricing
- Subscription mode for recurring payments
- Success and cancel URLs for redirection after payment

The server then returns a session ID to the client.
```

**Client-side Implementation**:
On the frontend, your application needs to:
1. Initialize the Stripe client with your publishable key
2. Handle checkout button clicks
3. Request a checkout session from your server
4. Redirect the user to Stripe's hosted checkout page

This approach keeps sensitive payment details off your servers, as customers enter their payment information directly on Stripe's secure checkout page.
```

### PayPal

[PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/) offers an alternative payment solution with:

- **Global Reach**: Access to PayPal's large user base
- **Express Checkout**: One-click purchasing for PayPal account holders
