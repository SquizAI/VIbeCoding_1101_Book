- Admin dashboard for inventory management

Please provide a comprehensive architecture diagram showing:
1. Major components and their relationships
2. Data flow between components
3. Database schema overview
4. API endpoints structure
5. Authentication flow
6. Recommended tech stack with justification
```

### Code Organization and Standards

Professional projects require consistent organization:

```

- Infinite scrolling implementation
- Mutation with optimistic updates
- Background refetching strategies
- Error boundary integration

Show examples of how this would be implemented for our product catalog and user orders.
```

## Testing Strategies

Production applications require comprehensive testing:

### Testing Framework Setup

```
Design a comprehensive testing strategy for our React e-commerce application with:
- Unit tests for business logic and utilities
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for feature flows
- End-to-end tests with Cypress
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing

Include example test setups, configuration files, and CI integration.
```

### Test-Driven Development with AI

```
I'm implementing a shopping cart feature using TDD. Help me through this process by:
1. Designing test cases for the shopping cart functionality
2. Implementing the tests first
3. Creating the actual implementation to pass the tests
4. Refactoring while maintaining test coverage

The shopping cart should support adding/removing items, quantity updates, price calculation with discounts, and persistence.
```

## Advanced Styling and UX

Professional applications need sophisticated UI implementations:

### Design System Implementation

```
Help me create a design system for our e-commerce platform that includes:
- A component library with atomic design principles
