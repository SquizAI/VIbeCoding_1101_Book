## 🚀 Chapter Overview

Welcome to Chapter 9 of Vibe Coding 101, our second capstone chapter that focuses on taking the application built in Chapter 8 and deploying it to production. This chapter demonstrates the complete journey from a finished codebase to a fully deployed, production-ready application using AI-assisted workflows.

This capstone project guides you through setting up deployment pipelines, configuring infrastructure, implementing monitoring and observability, hardening security, and establishing maintenance practices—all with the assistance of AI tools. By the end of this chapter, you'll have deployed the task management application from Chapter 8 into a robust production environment ready for real users.
